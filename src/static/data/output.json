{"news": [{"text": "CRM and 500 Startups incubated company Intercom has raised a seed round of $1 million from angel investors including twitter co-founder Biz Stone, Huddle founder Andy McLoughlin, Dan Martell, 500 Startups and Digital Garage. Intercom\u2019s  customer relationship management tool (CRM) is designed specifically for web businesses. The web-based SaaS features Google Analytics- like integration so that its database of customers is always automatically up- to-date, tracking every interaction. With its flexible filtering function, users can be segmented into groups for whom the business has different goals (i.e. converting free users into paying customers). Here\u2019s how the startup differs from the standard CRMs. Intercom get its data from a JavaScript snippet that users add to the applications, similar to Google Analytics. As a result of this, the platform automatically learns a businesses\u2019 customer base, and how they use a product. Intercom includes the ability to contact customers directly from the product itself, so if you see a high-profile user signing up, greeting him with a personal message in the app is super simple. You can also create messages based on rules within the app. For example \u201cshow users this message when they have spent more than $100\u201d , or \u201cshow all users with more than 1,000 twitter followers this message\u201d. In order to figure out who a businesses\u2019 users are, Intercom will track activity data of how often customers use an app, business data pertaining to what plan are they on and/or how much money have they spent, social network profile data and communications and contact data. All of this data, combined with the features mentioned above, will help online businesses convert trial users to paid accounts, and to grow a long-term relationship with customers, explains CEO and co-founder Eoghan McCabe. For example, beta customers like GitHub are using Intercom\u2019s messaging features to learn about and engage with their customers\u2014individually and automatically, at scale. The Intercom product, which has been in private beta, currently has 1,500 active users from 500 companies, tracking and communicating with over 1 million customers. \u201cIntercom brings real human relationships back into the picture for web businesses and their customers,\u201d says McCabe. \u201cAs \u2018software eats the world,\u2019 in the words of Marc Andreessen, and all businesses become web businesses, genuinely personal and personalized customer service is the most effective, long-lasting way for companies to differentiate their offering and fight commodification.\u201d McCabe and his co-founders Des Traynor, Ciaran Lee, and David Barrett all hail from Ireland and previously founders created error tracking service Exceptional, which was acquired in 2011. Today, Intercom will be available to the public and will be free until the first full version of the product launches this summer. ![](https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/conversation- view.png) ", "time": 1327449600, "value": 0}, {"text": "# Can Kids Love Chores? 500 Startups Alum HighScore House Says Yes If you\u2019re a parent, it can be a challenge to convince kids to do their chores. (Or so I\u2019m told.) It\u2019s even harder to make them genuinely excited. But a startup called HighScore House says it has found a way. The company is part of the latest class of companies incubated by 500 Startups, and it made its pitch to investors this afternoon as part of 500 Startups Demo Day. Co-founder Kyle Seaman says the company has been operating on an invite-only basis, but it\u2019s starting to open up to a wider audiences, and it\u2019s already getting excited messages from parents whose children are actually asking to do more chores. So what\u2019s the company doing? Games and rewards. HighScore House offers a website and an iPad app where children can track and earn points for their chores. Those points, in turn, can be redeemed for rewards \u2014 Seaman says the most popular rewards involve something that makes the child feel special, like ice cream for breakfast or riding shotgun in the car. Of course, you don\u2019t need a website to reward your kids for chores. But HighScore High should make it a lot easier. Even though the families set up the chores and rewards, the site makes suggestions so you don\u2019t have to think of things from scratch or wonder, \u201cShould this be worth 100 points or 1,000 points?\u201d It also makes it easier for kids to understand the expectations and to track their progress. Ultimately, Seaman says he wants to do for families what Zynga did for social networks and gaming. HighScore House has raised an angel round from Jason Bailey (general manager of Virtual Currency at Super Rewards), Kay Luo (who led PR at LinkedIn and Square), Dan Martell (co-founder of Flowtown), and James Levine (former CTO at SimplyHired). It plans to make money by charging a subscription fee (it\u2019s free while in beta testing), by selling digital goods for kids to decorate their virtual rooms, and by facilitating some of the rewards (for example offering gift cards and taking a cut).

And for the first time ever, it\u2019s going to open the process up to allow anyone to apply. To help it get through the process, 500 Startups Accelerator will be using AngelList, making it the first incubator to leverage the platform for applications. McClure told me that historically, the program has avoided having an open application process and instead has taken on Accelerator startups only through referrals. So far, that has worked out just fine for 500 Startups:  It\u2019s had four successful incubator programs, usually with 20 to 35 startups participating. As a result, McClure & Co. have been able to avoid the frustrating, time- consuming process of reviewing applications. That said, McClure told me that, while referrals have helped it to find a ton of interesting startups \u2014 and avoid sorting through a lot of crap \u2014 he also recognized that he\u2019s probably missed a few that might not have been part of his network. That\u2019s where AngelList  comes in. The professional network for startups and investors will help 500 Startups vet applicants through a mix of algorithmic ranking and curation from mentors and others. The AngelList platform will help speed up the process by weeding out unqualified applicants. It will also allow 500 Startups to scale up the application process without having to manually review all the applications by hand. Not everyone in the next class will come from AngelList \u2014 500 Startups expects to choose between five and 10 startups through this process. It\u2019s already picked a few to participate and is reviewing several others. But McClure said that it was important to open up the applications process in a way that would allow it to review companies that it might not have seen. That\u2019s especially important because so much of 500 Startups\u2019 focus is on startups that are somewhat non-typical, for instance those that are in international markets. In addition to opening up the application process, 500 Startups is changing the terms of its investment for companies that have already raised some funding. Typically, it provides $50,000 for 5 percent of equity, with an option for up to $200,000 in later rounds. But companies that have raised at least $250,000 will be able to join the program for only 3 to 4 percent of equity. The fifth 500 Startups Accelerator will begin in October, with Demo Days in late January or early February. Companies interested in applying can do so on AngelList at angel.co/500startups.

This latest round of investments means that 500Startups now owns stakes in 16 Mexican companies through its subsidiary, Mexican.vc, based in Mexico City. 500Startups partner Santiago Zavala said that each of the companies would receive a $25,000 cash investment in addition to workspace and other services, including a startup bootcamp, in exchange for a 10% equity stake. Zavala said the companies chosen were typically very early stage startups with 2-3 \u201cvery passionate cofounders,\u201d with technical, design, and business backgrounds in the core team. \u201cWe really care about design, data, and distribution, as well as a passionate team,\u201d Zavala said. The companies chosen in this round represent a wide variety of market sectors, with a strong common thread being their focus on a Web 2.0 approach to problem-solving. Two of the companies, Capptalog and Shopinterest, are clearly focusing on the North American market, judging by the exclusive use of English on their highly-produced websites. Capptalog is a cloud-based platform for creating and managing catalogs that aims to centralize management of their production. The service allows customers to use a variety of media formats, including XML and HTML5, to display products on a range of mobile devices. Capptalog works on a freemium model, with up to 1 user and 10 products free; additional users or products are charged a monthly fee. Shopinterest could be described as \u201cShopify for Pinterest.\u201d Pinterest users can create turnkey online stores to sell content they have pinned on their Pinterest account. They can receive payment for the products using PayPal, with Shopinterest taking a fee for each transaction. Francisco Guerrero, one of the founders, worked in e-commerce for over a decade. He explained that the company \u201c\u2026 had noticed that Pinterest was converting well but there was no way to measure [it]. We first started working on analytics but realized our users wanted an easier way to sell, more than the analytics themselves. So we built an e-commerce platform, already with sellers selling over 1,000 items.\u201d Guerrero said the company wants to be ready for Christmas. \u201cOur short-term plan is to have our site up and running for the holidays, generate some traction via sales, and be ready to look for additional investors now that we \u2026 have some sales and revenue.\u201d Other companies in this investment round were focused on solving problems in Mexico and Latin America, including:   * Boletia, a conference management and ticket sales suite   * Etraining, a crowdsourced education platform that uses a Kickstarter-like approach to measuring interest in classes before making them available   * GarageCoders, which produced Callsuite, an app that centralizes contact lists and allows users to interact with people in their social networks and send email, initiate phone calls, and send text messages from one app   * Nuperty, a real estate discovery marketplace   * Rubberit, the \u201cDollar Shave Club for Condoms\u201d   * SeMeAntoja, a multi-platform online food delivery website with a freemium model for restaurants, and   * Yaxi, which uses an Uber-like software model to order and pay for safe taxis (this is a big deal in Mexico City, which has the largest taxi fleet in the world, some of which are considered substandard and even dangerous). Zavala highlighted Rubberit as one of the more surprising stories from this investment round. \u201cWhen we first heard about them, we were a little bit skeptical about the business and product/market fit, so after the first interview \u2026 we told them about the challenges we saw in the industry and society. They very quickly released a [test version of the service] and got a hundred orders from a dozen different states in Mexico, so we saw that it was really interesting and the team could handle the delivery and the go-to market.\u201d _M.

McClure filed with the SEC to form a new, $5 million limited partnership VC fund called 500 StartupWallah. \u201cWallah\u201d is a common Indian suffix used to convey the kind of work you do. E.g., a chai-wallah is someone who serves tea; a bottley-wallah is someone who does recycling; a startup-wallah is someone who does startups. The fund has yet to make its first sale of securities (i.e., raise its hoped- for $5 million). But with McClure\u2019s provenance and connections (remember, he\u2019s one of the Paypal Mafia), $5 million should be small, easily gathered potatoes. We\u2019ve been in touch with McClure about the filing; due to the extremely early nature of the fund, he\u2019s unable to offer any comment. But if you follow McClure\u2019s _other_ money, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s looking into a number of regions where technology is huge and in a position to have a large impact on sometimes-struggling economies and even democratize social strata. Earlier this year, he took part in a super-angel, pan-Asian project called Jungle Ventures. He also acquired a Mexican VC fund outright, giving 500 Startups a foothold in Latin America. Even the current 500 Startups application process is geared toward finding talent outside the Valley, and in its most recent batch, 57 percent of the incubator\u2019s teams were international. Put it altogether, and whaddaya get? McClure\u2019s going for India and the rest of the world, obvs. _Additional reporting by VentureBeat writer Rebecca Grant._ ", "time": 1353369600, "value": 0}, {"text": "It\u2019s hard to believe, but it\u2019s been just three years since 500 Startups started making investments in early-stage companies. But in that time, the firm has put money in at least 500 companies, and it will keep investing in more, thanks to the closing of its second fund and the continued growth of its team. As previously reported, the second fund for 500 Startups closed at $44.1 million in July. That was above its $29.4 million initial fund but below its $50 million target for Fund II. At the same time, however, 500 Startups has been raising a number of region-specific funds in places like India and Mexico. 500 Startups has grown substantially since it was founded three years ago. It\u2019s expanded from the two founding partners \u2014 McClure and Christine Tsai \u2014 to 30 employees, of which 10 make investments. It also has a fairly international presence, with employees in Brazil, Mexico, China, India, and Malaysia, as well as its home office in Mountain View. The firm has now made investments in well over 500 startups (actually, close to 600, according to McClure), but have no fear \u2014 it\u2019s not changing its name anytime soon. It\u2019s averaged about 150 investments per year over its first few years, but is on pace to do 200 investments this year. McClure says the firm has no plans to slow down: In fact, with the number of venture partners on board making investments, 500 Startups could put money into well over 200 startups in 2014. He imagines each member of the investment team making 20 or so bets each, which is a lot more scalable than say, when 500 Startups launched and it was just McClure and Tsai writing checks. Having its investments more evenly spread across its partners could bolster its focus overseas, as many of the folks writing checks at 500 are focused on specific geographical regions. The firm has strategically hired investment partners for a variety of overseas markets in the past year or so. Of these, Brazil and Mexico are probably showing the best results so far, McClure said, but they\u2019re also the most mature markets that it\u2019s been placing bets on. The firm is also optimistic about India, China, and Southeast Asia, although its efforts there are newer. ### Early Results Overall, while it\u2019s just three years in, 500 Startups is starting to see some positive results in terms of the number of companies that have had exits \u2014 or at least those which have gone on to raise Series A and later rounds of funding. Notable investments that have resulted in exits include Wildfire, acquired by Google for $350 million; Makerbot, purchased by Stratasys for $400 million; and Viki, which was bought by Rakuten for $200 million. Meanwhile, companies like Twilio, CreditKarma, SendGrid, TaskRabbit, and 42 Floors continue to chug along and have taken on Series B and later rounds of investment. While it\u2019s done a large volume of seed investments, the firm is seeing about 15 to 20 percent of its bets moving on to later stages of funding. McClure expects that to increase over time, to get closer to an internal target of 20-30 percent. Believe it or not, even while 500 Startups is writing more checks each year, McClure believes that it\u2019s been making better investments over time. Nowhere is that more apparent than in the 500 Startups Accelerator program, where the team has had to become ultra-selective about which companies it accepts. For its seventh batch in the accelerator, 500 Startups once again accepted applications via AngelList and had to choose from about 1,200 startups that applied. It narrowed that number down to 30 that were accepted and will take part in the program, which starts next week in Mountain View. One reason that 500 Startups Accelerator is gaining interest is that it has strong expertise in marketing and distribution, and it\u2019s looking to continue differentiating in this area. To that end, it\u2019s hired a four-person distribution team to help its portfolio companies refine their products to better reach target customers.

You can follow him on Twitter@ferrantim where your tweets in English and fran\u00e7ais are welcome, or on his blog._ For the last three years, a highlight of my year has been a design conference called Warmgun organized by 500Startups. It\u2019s always held in the stylish Kabuki Hotel in San Francisco\u2019s Japantown, a venue that I\u2019d be surprised can house next year\u2019s conference since it was absolutely packed. Unlike most conferences which focus on tactical how-to\u2019s, Warmgun has consistently made attendees think about WHAT they are doing, not just HOW they are doing it. Like all 500Startups events, the sessions are all taped and recorded, so not being there is no reason to miss out on the lessons from some of technology\u2019s best-known speakers from startups like Uber, Github, Mailchimp, and Etsy, and established companies like Amazon, Intuit and Adobe. ## UX strategy means business Rather than Warmgun starting the way it usually does\u2013 with 500Startups founding partner Dave McClure screaming and cussing about\u2026everything\u2013it started with the more sober, but way funnier, Jared Spool of UIE, giving the most surprising, and insightful talk of the day. During his talk, Spool argued the completely unsurprising and uninsightful case that all good business models are designed and that all designers should understand the business model of their company. #boring ![Gnomes_plan](https://www.rudebaguette.com/assets/Gnomes_plan.png) What made the talk so unique is that in the past, most user experience discussions have focused on either the fact that user experience is important to begin with or how tactically to make it easier for the user to use the product in question. And many talks at this year\u2019s conference continued on that theme (a particularly good one was responsive design guru Luke Wroblewski\u2019s talk _Designing Across Devices: The Future Media & Cross Device Web Design)_. But what Spool challenged the audience to think about was if designers aren\u2019t thinking big enough about Design. Fundamentally, great business models are DESIGNED. It\u2019s not an accident that Amazon.com can sell its products at cost and still make a profit (Spool explained they can do this by turning over their inventory faster than they have to pay their suppliers, earning interest on the resulting cash). Designers who stop at the pixel to perfect their \u201cdesign\u201d certainly aren\u2019t stretching the limits of where their craft can lead. Even designers who push their way into the core application functionality are not maximizing the business opportunity if they don\u2019t understand how the user behavior they are enabling will affect business metrics like increased revenue or decreased costs. ## We are all designers If I had to sum up the theme of Warmgun 2013, it would be with the words of Paco Vi\u00f1oly, Design Director, at mobile payments company Square: \u201cWe are all designers.\u201d Vi\u00f1oly was speaking more specifically about engineers being designers, but I think the concept extends well beyond \u201cdesigners\u201d vs. \u201cengineers.\u201d Georges Clemenceau, France\u2019s prime minister during the end of World War I, famously quipped that war is too important to be left to the generals. The same can be said for design and business. Too often, especially in larger companies, we overvalue \u201cexpertise\u201d and undervalue critical thinking. Expertise in a domain does not equate to ability to succeed with customers, the ultimate driver of business success. Likewise, critical thinking and creative problem solving doesn\u2019t stop at the edges of our learned trade. When we think about creating a great company, design is clearly a huge part of that. Such a huge part that every person in the organization needs to think about how the stuff that gets \u201cshipped\u201d impacts customers or users and the business itself. Making good decisions purposefully is design. And we are all designers.

Today, the seed-stage investment firm and accelerator is making announcements on both fronts, as it\u2019s brought on two new venture partners and announced the 28 companies that will participate in its eighth 500 Startups Accelerator class. First, on the staffing side: The firm has hired Sean Percival and Marvin Liao as its newest venture partners. While 500 Startups traditionally has hired aggressively to build out its network of investors in specific markets around the world, both of these new investors will be based in Silicon Valley. And both bring some experience in helping companies find growth and distribution. Percival is probably best known as the co-founder of lalawag and Wittlebee, but he had also once-upon-a-time served as VP of Online Marketing at Myspace. As an adviser at Bitcoin wallet and block explorer BlockChain and founder of Bitcoin news site BubbleCoin, it should probably not come as a surprise that he will be focused on making investments around everyone\u2019s favorite crypto- currency. He\u2019ll also be heading up 500\u2019s half-day \u201cBitcoinference\u201d on the topic in March. Liao, meanwhile, spent more than a decade at Yahoo, where he has held roles in sales, business development, ad operations and marketing. Much of his experience was spent in regional or global management roles in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, and the U.S. Liao will be working to find interesting startups and help out with the Accelerator program in Mountain View and San Francisco. Which brings us to the next bit of news \u2014 the next 500 Startups  Accelerator class. This group, which is the eighth overall for the firm, will be the first to run out of 500 Startups\u2019 new San Francisco office in the city\u2019s SOMA district. Participating companies will still get office space to work out of, as well as access to mentors, events, and programs aimed to help startups refine their products and grow their businesses. They\u2019ll just have better restaurant and nightlife options than on Mountain View\u2019s Castro Street. A total of 28 companies have been chosen, out of thousands that applied, and represent a wide range of U.S.-based and international startups. There are companies from Spain, India, France, Canada, Jordan, Israel, Egypt, Brazil, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, as well as from cities outside the Silicon Valley center of gravity, including Las Vegas, Austin, NYC, and Detroit. The launch of its latest batch signals the firm\u2019s move to run the Accelerator year-round, with two classes in Mountain View per year, which will slightly overlap with the two that are taking place in San Francisco. According to founding partner Christine Tsai, the 500 Startups Accelerator will likely have about 120 companies go through it each year, as each class houses about 30 startups. Its previous Mountain View class is having demo day this week, for instance, and applications for its next Mountain View Accelerator class are already open and will run through February 21.

By feeding some inputs in the app, parents can figure out if their child has any developmental or learning disorder. ![Yourstory-My-Child-App- Funding](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/wordpress/2016/01/Yourstory-My-Child- App-Funding.jpg?fm=png&auto=format) Founders of My Child App The idea of My Child App had come to Harsh, out of a personal experience. Diagnosed with Dyspraxia, Harsh realised the importance of discovery and treatment of learning and developmental disorder in their early stages. Speaking on investing in My Child App, Amit says, \"My Child App is leveraging the power of smartphone to solve real-world health problem. It\u2019s amazing to see what Harsh has done at such a young age. I am sure his innovation will inspire many other entrepreneurs in finding many such use cases in improving the quality and predictability human life.\" The app helps parents screen disorders like delayed motor coordination and neurological disorders. All of these are key disorders that can be detected in children aged 11\u201324 months. The app takes inputs from the parent, like height and weight, and asks some \u2018yes or no\u2019 questions. After that, it displays the result informing about the areas of concern in a child and thereby suggesting the action to be taken. Pankaj Jain, Partner, 500 startups says that getting information about developmental disorders and details on whom to speak with on a simple mobile app just by answering few simple questions is transformative. He adds, \"It in fact is very powerful in regions where mental health professionals aren't readily available or where parents don't have access to the right medical professionals. We look forward to working with Harsh and the team on improving lives for parents and children across the globe.\" Harsh adds that they also intend to develop a community in the near future to help parents communicate with other parents and doctors via the app. In the next 10 years, Harsh wants the app to touch 50 million parents. He is also working to make the app a guide for efficient parenting, and be able to detect autism. Samir adds, \u201cI have watched Harsh build his company for over a year before deciding to back him. He's a rare breed of entrepreneur who's taken a personal weakness and made it into a business that can help millions of people afflicted with similar problems. That he's still a teenager speaks volumes of his determination to make an impact in this world.\u201d ##  **YourStory take** In India, 13\u201314 per cent of all school children suffer from one or the other kind of learning disability. Globally, research and development on learning disorders began during the 1950s and 1960s. Psychologists and psychiatrists began studying children who displayed normal intellectual skills, but displayed different kinds of cognitive limitations. The current global epidemiological data reports that at least 20 per cent of children and adolescents suffer from a mental disorder. While both the global and Indian statistics are alarming, there is little empathy and understanding on the subject.

Martin E. Klimek, USA TODAY SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Monique Woodard has joined 500 Startups as its first African- American venture partner to increase the firm's investments in black and Latino tech entrepreneurs, who have historically received a tiny fraction of U.S. venture funding. The appointment of a black investor at the start-up accelerator and venture firm \"sends a huge signal that black investors are needed and that we should have a seat at the table,\" Woodard told USA TODAY. Woodard is executive director of Black Founders, a national network of African-American tech entrepreneurs that she co-founded. \"We have to diversify who's going out there and finding companies and who's writing the checks,\" she said. \"That is incredibly important. It's hard to find black and Latino founders if you don't have black and Latino investors on your staff.\" For decades Silicon Valley has wrestled with its stark lack of racial diversity. Nowhere is that more evident than in the venture capital industry, which is dominated by white men who, by and large, fund very few start-ups founded by underrepresented minorities and women. A report in 2010 by CB Insights found that fewer than 1% of venture capital-backed Internet companies were founded by African Americans. 500 Start-ups, co-founded by Dave McClure and Christine Tsai, wants to shake that up. 500 Startups has $200 million in assets under management. Its team of 100 people manage seed-stage investments in more than 1,500 companies in 20 countries including three unicorn start-ups: GrabTaxi, Twilio and Credit Karma. Even before Woodard's appointment, the investing team at 500 Startups was more diverse than at most venture firms. Eleven of 33 partners on investment team are women. In the last four years, 500 Startups has backed more than 400 female-led companies. 500 Startups says it does not have figures on the racial composition of its team or on the number of black or Latino-led start-ups it has invested in. ![500 Startups co-founder Christine Tsai at a Women in](https://www.gannett- cdn.com/-mm-/79a8abf45176b3ef7cb6cb1746b6df38d330d02a/c=0-43-511-724/local/-/media/2016/02/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/635903650702260121-Tsai.JPG?width=180&height=240&fit=crop) 500 Startups co-founder Christine Tsai at a Women in Technology Roundtable discussion focusing on venture capitalists in 2012. (Photo: Jessica Brandi Lifland, USA TODAY) \"Monique is super talented and the fact that she does have a strong passion for diversity and inclusion with respect to the entrepreneurial and venture capital community, that just aligns with what we do,\" Tsai said. Tsai says Silicon Valley is overlooking big ideas in untapped markets at its own peril. \"Unfortunately a lot of Silicon Valley venture capitalists are disconnected from African Americans, Latinos and other people of color. They don't understand these markets and, unfortunately, if they don't understand them they are inclined to say, 'I don't get it,' or 'I can't help you,' or 'I don't think that's a big market,'\" she said. 500 Startups says it has made investments in a number of companies with minority founders including Walker & Co., Tristan Walker's company which makes the Bevel shaving system, and Mayvenn, which helps beauticians sell hair extensions and other products. Now, McClure says, 500 Startups is going after under-served but influential markets. \"I think our hearts are in the right place. More importantly, the market is there and I think we can make a lot of money,\" McClure said. \"Another win for the industry,\" Walker said of Woodard's appointment. \"Diversity matters, and most noticeably, at its earliest stages and Dave knows it. It's just good business. 500 Startups has been ahead of the curve in that regard.\" Thank you! You're almost signed up for Keep an eye out for an email to confirm your newsletter registration. Woodard is one of a small group of black investors in Silicon Valley that she says she can count on one hand. They include Y Combinator's Michael Seibel, Precursor Ventures' Charles Hudson, Intel Capital's Lisa Lambert and Laurence \"Lo\" Toney from GV (formerly known as Google Ventures). Woodard has spent the past eight years steeped in the Silicon Valley start-up scene. Black Founders, which she will still run as executive director, hosts events and workshops in cities and at historically black universities and colleges around the country. Recently Black Founders launched a mentoring program to pair entrepreneurs with experienced founders. And it's focused on creating more funding resources for black entrepreneurs, especially at the early stage. Woodard says 500 Startups shared that vision. \"I very specifically wanted to work at the early stage when founders need the most help and the most support. 500 Startups makes a lot of bets and I wanted to be able to make a lot of bets, not just focus on three or four deals,\" Woodard said. \"Being able to do that at the early stage is really important. That's where you can make the most impact for black and Latino founders.\"  _Follow USA TODAY senior technology writer Jessica Guynn_@jguynn Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1XdPpOh ", "time": 1454889600, "value": 0}, {"text": "500 Startups  is continuing its efforts to tap on Asia\u2019s fast-growing startup scene after the U.S.-headquartered VC firm announced a $10 million fund in Vietnam. The effort is led by Binh Tran and Eddie Thai, two partners 500 Startups hired last year, and it is its first in Vietnam and latest in a series of country- led initiatives. In Asia over the past year, 500 Startups has introduced funds in Japan ($30 million), Korea ($15 million), India ($25 million) and Thailand ($12 million), and doubled the size of its kitty for Southeast Asia to $20 million. Vietnam is viewed as promising for a number of reasons. The country has a 90 million population, over half of whom are aged under 30, and is a mobile-first market with huge potential for technology and internet businesses. To date, politics and culture are among the factors that have prevented international VCs setting up shop in the country in droves, but Thai hopes to push things forward. \u201cThe timing is right,\u201d he told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cTen years ago when VCs first came here there were around four million internet users, now there are around 40 million. There really is potential to grow connectivity, income and spending.\u201d Entrepreneurship and startups have shown signs of promise in Vietnam for some time, as a New York Times article last year chronicled, but Thai believes this is just the start. \u201cWe really want to bring this to the next level, [and make the country\u2019s startup scene] more efficient, professional and founder friendly \u2014 and ultimately build companies that can exit,\u201d he said. The $10 million fund isn\u2019t ready yet \u2014 a first close is likely this month with a final close expected in June \u2014 but already Vietnam-based Thai and former Klout CTO Tran, who is located in Silicon Valley for deal flow and cross- border opportunities, have dipped into the money. Thus far, 500 Startups has invested in at least six companies with connections to Vietnam, be that overseas with Vietnamese founders or teams on the ground in the country. 500 Startups is known for its prolific investment volume \u2014 it has put money into more than 1,500 companies worldwide \u2014 and that approach will continue in Vietnam. The fund is expected to yield 100-150 investments that will vary from $100,000 to $250,000 in check size. As is the case with its other micro-funds, that\u2019ll predominantly cover early-stage rounds which are shared with co- investors. Beyond spending money, the 500 Startups Vietnam team wants to develop the local ecosystem by educating investors, founders and others players. 500 Startups well known for its global accelerator program and, while there\u2019s no plan to set anything similar up locally, but Thai said they will \u201csupport\u201d those building early-stage programs. Beyond helping startups apply for the 500 Startups\u2019 accelerator program in Silicon Valley, he said the Vietnam partners may also launch a version of Distro Dojo, a post-funding growth program that the firm has run worldwide. But the focus isn\u2019t just on igniting the startup spark at home, Thai wants to connect the dots globally. He said there\u2019s a strong diaspora of tech talent overseas that may want to return/or be involved at home, while others are looking in, too. \u201c[The fund\u2019s LPs include] overseas diaspora who understand Vietnam, want to do angel and seed investing, and see this as a way to get returns and help build the country. Overseas companies want to expand [because they] find domestic growth harder \u2014 in Japan and Korea, for example. They want access [to Vietnam] but don\u2019t know the way,\u201d he explained.

Winning might mean looking in places and at ideas investors might not expect to be successful. This time around, there are two tracks: business-to- business, and beauty and fashion. There are a lot of interesting ideas in this round, and a lot that already exist in some fashion or compete with larger companies that can easily go after the space.

Called 500 Labs,  it\u2019s a new attempt at finding interesting ideas that might turn out to be good investments. 500 Startups essentially brings in developers and entrepreneurs in residence, giving them the resources to play around with ideas until they find one that sticks. It\u2019s not a particularly new model \u2014 there are others like Betaworks and Andy Rubin\u2019s hardware-centric Playground. 500 Startups hopes to differentiate itself as a startup incubator by giving founders and developers the ability to lean on its large growth marketing team. McClure argues that it has one of the largest growth marketing teams in the VC community, giving it the ability to help spark an initial seed audience for projects that will hopefully start taking off on its own in addition to paid acquisition. You can think of it as a sort of extension of the entrepreneur-in-residence program that many VC firms have in the Valley. 500 Labs pairs up potential candidates based on their qualifications \u2014 a developer with a general manager, for example \u2014 and gives them room to try out a bunch of ideas. They\u2019re salaried, which means it carries less risk than running off to start a new company off an idea that may be destined to fail, and gives creators room to rapidly try new ideas. 500 Startups expects to be working on around 10 projects at a time, with 3 or 4 of them being spun into companies if they exhibit some potential and high growth. 500 Labs candidates have the benefit of leaning on the 500 Startups infrastructure to handle difficult early-stage tasks like recruiting and marketing, and creating paid acquisition campaigns, Selcuk Atli \u2014 one of the leads on the program, along with Dom Coryell \u2014 said. That marketing team is also constantly looking for new avenues, like potentially AR and VR in the future, 500 Startups co-founder Dave McClure said. \u201cAs much as startups have high attrition rates, founders have experience in a particular domain have a higher success rate,\u201d McClure said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different model, it\u2019s model has been proven to work in other scenarios. I think if you [mess] it up enough times you\u2019re going get good at doing it.\u201d For creators, the bar for potential investments will be even higher than the one startups face when looking to apply to the firm\u2019s accelerator program, McClure said. That\u2019s partly because the founders that are working on these projects are expected to have the experience and skills to help cultivate strong ideas and grow them. For example, for an app-based model to be successful, McClure said the firm expects something in the tens to hundreds of thousands of downloads before it\u2019s considered to be spun out into a new company. A couple of example projects that 500 Labs might spin up would be e-commerce or marketplace services, and other online software-based services that have a natural growth arc that can be supplemented by 500 Startups\u2019 growth team. The firm is also looking into enterprise productivity tools, as an example of potential ideas it might explore in the enterprise space. \u201cWe have a pretty broad area, but we\u2019re trying to confine all these things under the mobile umbrella so we can tactically share resources,\u201d Selcuk said. \u201cIf you\u2019re working on the mobile, you\u2019re working on app store optimization for example. We feel that\u2019s an advantage to have not so much of a narrow focus but a broad enough focus so we can share resources.\u201d Those founders don\u2019t necessarily have to be the original creators of successful products \u2014 they could also be top-level lieutenants at those companies, Atli said. \u201cI think we\u2019re probably looking at core disciplines in engineering, design and marketing areas we\u2019re going after,\u201d Atli said. \u201cThat might not have been the founders of previous companies, it could be senior principals. Kind of like the Facebook and PayPal mafias, we\u2019d like to find successful companies with a second level of experience who might want to start things.\u201d The concept was always in the back of McClure and his team\u2019s mind, but it was over a round of drinks and hookah that Selcuk and McClure finally sealed the deal. McClure said he was basically waiting for the resources and the right personnel to finally roll the project out. Initially, the Labs model will focus on remote locations like Waterloo and Toronto \u2014 places with a bevy of tech talent that would have otherwise been recruited by the now-dead (or basically dead) BlackBerry \u2014 but the idea is to constantly give them a presence in Silicon Valley. \u201cWhen companies get funded they can move anywhere,\u201d Atli said. \u201cWe found pockets of talent in interesting and amazing places. Vietnam, Waterloo, Berlin, Istanbul, there\u2019s talent all over the world but there isn\u2019t always much access to capital. Combining a Silicon Valley HQ with access to other communities all over the world, we think we can be really effective.\u201d Of course, all this would be moot if it weren\u2019t a successful outcome for the firm as well. 500 Startups is aiming that founders will have double-digit point ownership of the companies that are spun out of the incubator, but the overall ownership structure is still being worked out between the team and founders. McClure and Atli shy away from comparisons to other accelerators and incubators, though it\u2019s hard not to draw analogies between a program like 500 Labs and Betaworks. But McClure argues that with its network of thousands of founders, it can lean on that network for potential candidates for 500 Labs that those other firms might not have access.

Over eight years back, when working for startups wasn\u2019t a fad, she dared to join one - PayMate. Meet Yosha Gupta . When asked about her ride from Aligarh to Hong Kong, today\u2019s 33-year-old Yosha is reminiscent of her journey. \u201cI haven\u2019t been there in the last 6 years. It was a really small town, but never felt like one. When you are from a small town, it only fuels your drive to prove yourself.\u201d My dad used to run the biggest women\u2019s college in Aligarh. I\u2019ve grown up seeing him. This made me pretty business savvy. I\u2019m used to business cycles and stress\u201d, she adds. That she is. I ask her about the current e-commerce slump. \u201cEver since the government announced they (e-commerce companies) can\u2019t fund discount, there was a definite slump. The offline retailers lobbied in the new regulation. From what I hear, they have started it again. The market scenario will get better\u201d, she shrugs. Age was a factor that pushed her into having something of her own. She was pushed by the idea to start soon before it\u2019s \u2018too late\u2019. Enter Lafalafa .com. Officially launched in January 2015, it\u2019s an online coupon and cashback selling portal to cater to the deal-hungry Indian and Chinese population. The firm operates from Gurgaon and Hong Kong. Why Hong Kong? \u201cWell, because of my husband. I know it\u2019s not the best of answers\u201d, Gupta blushes. She moved to Hong Kong at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. With over a decade of experience in the mobile payments industry across Asia, the idea of LafaLafa.com seemed imperative. \u201cWe started a bit later than we should have in India, but we are the cashback player in Hong Kong\u201d, she smiles. Judging that discounts and cashback have been around for a long time, Gupta believes innovation plays a major role in defining how we get more users. \u201cThere\u2019s always innovation around. When we started out, there was no focus on mobile. CashKaro still doesn\u2019t have a mobile app, and we got a million downloads in than a year\u201d, she observes. Gupta now earmarks 15-20% of her time to brainstorm of new products and services. The network she picked up from the 1800 strong founders team from 500Startups always helps. She\u2019s currently into deep linking and conversational commerce. \u201cIt was pretty surreal. Having worked in tech companies for over a decade, those 4 months in Mountain View were a dream come true. There\u2019s a huge feeling of shared success\u201d, Yosha grins. Did we tell you Yosha shuttles between Hong Kong and Gurgaon like it\u2019s next door? \u201cIt\u2019s only a 5 hour flight away.

There\u2019s Y Combinator, Techstars and 500 Startups,  among many others. But with so many choices, it might be easy for an outside observer to not really directly distinguish between them. For Dave McClure \u2014 who wants to show that his firm 500 Startups can offer something more than the rest of those programs \u2014 that\u2019s an issue. The accelerator program, which has been running for several years, is one in which the firm looks to put a lot of emphasis on growth. So, starting today, they\u2019re ditching the nomenclature as the firm tries to overtly show the differences between what 500 Startups offers and the rest of the batch. They\u2019re now called the \u201c500 Seed Program\u201d and the \u201c500 Series A Program,\u201d both of which have shown to have an increasing barrier to entry, McClure said. For companies looking to join either program, the firm is going to have to see some kind of traction, McClure said. The differentiation between the programs is more along the lines of where the company is looking to invest, compared to the structures that other accelerators have. The 500 Seed program, in particular, is looking for some raw metrics that show the companies are going in the right direction before joining. Beforehand, the accelerator would accept companies at an earlier stage for a $50,000 check at five points in the company. \u201cFor certain business models, revenue is the right metric, others might be monthly active users, or one or two enterprise pilots,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general we\u2019re trying to develop customer acquisition models from something that\u2019s not zero.\u201d Now, the 500 Seed Program will serve out a $150,000 check for six points in the company, minus a $37,000 tuition fee. Those fees help the firm continue to operate with a lot of overhead as its staff and added services continue to grow over time, with more than 100 people operating. The accelerator traditionally can cost millions of dollars to operate, McClure said. \u201cIt\u2019s more a philosophy of when we like to invest,\u201d McClure said. \u201cFintech, it\u2019s not easy to do a lean startup method, you have to make sure things works. There are maybe a little more propensity for Y Combinator to bring in companies where they\u2019re betting on the founder and company progress may or may not matter. We\u2019re more likely to say we want to help them with growth marketing, we need to see a functional product with most categories and some amount of customer traction.\u201d The 500 Series A program is more geared toward startups that are starting to see a lot of traction and need help with the growth and marketing of their companies. That added services is 500 Startups\u2019 sweet spot, McClure said, and the program consists of checks between $150,000 and $250,000, again minus a $50,000 tuition fee. All of this is to say that the firm is looking to give a strong selling point to its partners that it provides a different kind of value beyond the other accelerators out there. Seed-stage accelerators are often a good entry point for investors looking to get into companies very early \u2014 even pre-product \u2014 and part of that literally comes down to the branding and optics in order to attract the best companies. \u201cA lot of LPs say that\u2019s the first entry point for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe actually think that\u2019s probably a better average return than the seed stage case. You can get in at a lower valuation, get more time with the companies and learn more about them.You understand more on the good and the bad.\u201d For McClure and 500 Startups, much of the job is traveling the world looking for deal flow. The firm has a number of micro-funds and other ways to try to source the best deal flow it can, in addition to its existing venture fund. The structure in place is now geared toward streamlining that and helping the firm itself continue to grow in order to add those additional services and value to its companies, he said.

Neumann brings with him an understanding of the big data space, along with experience gained at two companies that were acquired \u2014 Aster Data and DataHero, which he founded. \u201cI took some time off, did some traveling and some consulting on data strategy, all while trying to figure out what I was going to do next,\u201d he told VentureBeat. \u201cI knew the partners at 500 so I wound up volunteering and mentoring. At the end of last year, 500 Startups asked if I wanted to join full-time.\u201d Neumann shared that the take-away from his mentoring experience was that he found a lot of interesting startups and \u201cdidn\u2019t know if I wanted to start another company, but enjoyed helping them.\u201d Unlike traditional EIR roles at venture capital firms, where entrepreneurs provide value to companies in the portfolio while figuring out what they want to build next, 500 Startups asks EIRs to get hands-on with the program. Neumann said that 500 Startups was looking for someone with a background in data analytics and shared that he\u2019ll be working with dozens of companies, helping some bring to market business intelligence products and assisting others that are leveraging data in non-traditional markets, such as in fraud detection and government. But regardless of the company, his task is to help entrepreneurs translate what they\u2019re doing into business objectives that customers can understand. This includes answering such questions as how to price goods and services, how to sell the product, and how they can bridge the technology they\u2019re building with the needs of potential buyers. \u201cHaving been in operational roles for a dozen years in the data space, I found myself increasingly wanting to give back and have value with startups,\u201d Neumann said. \u201cWith 500 Startups, it\u2019s an opportunity to come in, give something back to the community, and see more about how 500 Startups as an organization works.\u201d Data science may be a hot topic in the industry, but it hasn\u2019t yet had its \u201cwow\u201d moment. Neumann believes this will happen when entrepreneurs build products that don\u2019t require customers to do a lot of work. He says that products should provide the answer users want without requiring them to interpret the data. But if there\u2019s a need to dig deeper into the data, products should support that. \u201cA lot of data-centric founders get lost in the weeds. They get excited about the analysis, but people want the value. They don\u2019t want to do the digging,\u201d Neumann said. \u201cFor most people, the value from data-centric products is in leveraging the data to do something. A lot of founders, particularly [those mathematically inclined], forget that people just don\u2019t care. They just want to take the data and do something wonderful.\u201d He advises entrepreneurs to think about it this way: \u201cWhatever you think is easy will be incredibly hard for users. Make it easier and keep doing that, keep iterating, and keep customers in the loop until your target market tells you it\u2019s magical and easier to use. Then it\u2019s easy to use.\u201d Neumann declined to state what he\u2019s going to be building next, instead reiterating that he\u2019s focused on helping startups in the 500 Startups portfolio.

Despite just closing today, 500 Startups  has already made 39 investments in MENA out of other funds, so the group does have experience deploying capital in the region. The Oman Investment Fund and the Qatar Science and Technology Park are serving as anchors for the new fund. The Oman Investment Fund has previously invested capital into 500 Startups\u2019 main fund, but the Qatar Science and Technology Park is new. ![](https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/unnamed1.jpg) Hasan Haider, the managing director of 500\u2019s MENA fund Hasan Haider, the managing director of the MENA fund, has a massive task ahead of him. The Middle East alone encompasses a land area nearly the size of the United States, and, as such, the role will involve a lot of traveling. Haider is based in Bahrain but will be making regular trips to cities that are hotbeds for business activity, like Cairo, Riyadh, Dubai and Doha, where 500\u2019s Series A program is located. Initially Haider will be joined by Sharif El-Badawi, a former Googler and a current leader of TechWadi, an association of tech-focused Arabs in Silicon Valley. To augment efforts and maximize the reach of the small team, the two are advising the Wadi Accelerator in Oman and assisting them with community events. 500 is calling this a first closing, which means it is possible that the size of the fund could increase in the future \u2014 it\u2019s targeting $30 million. Ideally this would mean increasing the size of the team to between seven and nine people to support the fund\u2019s efforts. Rather than wait it out, 500 has decided to get on the ground sooner rather than later to take advantage of the growing exit activity in MENA. \u201cThe Amazon acquisition of Souq was really a watershed moment for the region,\u201d Dave McClure, founding partner of 500 Startups, explained to me in an interview. The implication is that there is serious regional interest in venture capital investment. SoftBank grabbed headlines last year when news broke that the company was planning a $100 billion investment fund that would have substantial backing from Middle Eastern investors. The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund\u2019s $3.5 billion investment in Uber also comes to mind as indicative of the trend. \u201cRight now government-supported programs are incentivizing people to set up VC funds,\u201d notes Haider. \u201cM&A interest is coming from Europe and the Far East.\u201d Government-sponsored programs heavily incentivize country-specific investments, but Haider told me in an interview that he thinks it\u2019s wrong to look at the region as siloed-off countries. Instead, the idea is to grow the region as an ecosystem, working to increase the number of acquisitions and ultimately convincing more people to take the risk of starting a startup.

What's more, she is a VC representing a foreign fund and managing their India portfolio, and mother to a toddler. ![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/wordpress/2017/05/shalini- prakash-2-800_400.jpg?fm=png&auto=format) Shalini Prakash, Venture Partner, 500 Startups, is managing the India show single-handedly. Shalini Prakash does pack a punch. She is excited about her new role as venture partner at 500 Startups, and ready to talk her about her journey with the fund, how things have played out for 500 Startups in the last few months with their India fund not taking off, and what's next for India as far as 500 is concerned. Here is an excerpt from our conversation: ##  **500 Startups' India presence** With over 100 employees across the world, 500 Startups' main fund is based in the US. The early-stage venture fund and seed accelerator have investments in over 50 countries, most of which host the fund's micro funds. Though there is no India fund, they do have active investments in the country, having invested in close to 60 companies since 2011, including startups like ZipDial, PopXo, Instamojo, CultureAlley, SilverPush, KartRocket, and Headout. Shalini says, > \"Earlier this year, there was a misinterpretation that 500 would not make investments, but this wasn't true. We have always invested in India from the global fund, and we will continue to build our portfolio startups here. We have always believed in India's potential, and are committed to further investments here.\" In the short-term, the fund plans to continue to seed good entrepreneurs and provide value to 500's global network. The long-term vision is to launch an India fund and make more investments here, while gradually launching 500's global programmes in India, which will help the local ecosystem. Due to strategic challenges and the mechanics involved, setting up an India fund was taking longer to work out and put on hold. \"But we will soon have a strategy for India,\" she says. ##  **From aspiring entrepreneur to VC** \"I am as local as it gets,\" says the true-blue Bengalurean. Shalini holds an engineering degree, and started her career with Fidelity Investments. Soon after, she joined Lakshmi Pratury and INKtalks, and was with them for four years. Before joining 500, she was involved in the startup ecosystem as an EIR (Entrepreneur In Residence), and did a few consulting assignments with companies like InMobi. Inspired by all the interesting speakers she met at INKtalks, she was contemplating starting up herself. But then, in August 2015, 500 Startups happened, and there has been no looking back since. \"I was always interested in the VC world, but did not think the transition would happen so quickly. 500 was a good fit to my background--I had worked in the startup ecosystem and in a place like INKtalks, which is a community for leading thinkers and doers. \"The approach of 500 to venture capital is also community driven, with a belief in developing the ecosystem and investing in passionate entrepreneurs. I really resonate with this thought,\" she says. ##  **The lone ranger** Currently, Shalini is the only person from the team in India, and she says that, as a lone ranger, \"self-discipline and being organised helps\" her in juggling everything at her end. The management too has been very supportive. \"The global team provides all kind of support to ensure smooth operations in India. I have access to the global network of 500's people, funds, and connections, which are very useful for our companies in India.\" ![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/wordpress/2017/05/shalini- prakash-800_400.jpg?fm=png&auto=format) Shalini Prakash: We will soon have a strategy for India. Commenting on the support she has received from Dave McClure, Managing Partner at 500 Startups, she says, \"I work with the South-east Asian team, and I am in touch with Dave for whatever I need. So people are very supportive. \"Because I live in a country of a billion people, I get a lot of attention. Irrespective of the time zones, Dave responds within hours whenever I email him. It's an amazing feeling because I feel that Dave and management are on top of things and show they care.\u009d\" ##  **Where is the winter?** According to Shalini, the past two to three years have been a learning experience for all the stakeholders in the Indian startup ecosystem. \"From the VC and entrepreneur perspective, we have figured out what works in India, and how to set expectations on both sides of the coin.\" Two major recent developments--demonetisation and the disruption in the telecom space by Jio--have, according to Shalini, made the future more promising. \"In fact, the government is disrupting its own systems, and it's happening so fast that it is throwing up multiple opportunities for startups. What would have taken 10 to 12 years earlier will now take only five. Startups need to work on solutions that are real, India-based. Look at the Aadhaar stack and the BHIM app. I see a completely different India 10 years down the line.\" Shalini also points out how even sectors like dairy and agriculture are now seeing considerable change, with startups focused on building solutions for the traditional sectors. ##  **Taking over and building a pipeline** With the Indian team disbanded, Shalini has spent most of her time since December taking over India and familiarising herself with all the portfolio companies. She has now settled down and is working on creating her own pipeline. Her days regularly include three important things--closing deals, portfolio support, and talking to new founders. Given that 500 is a foreign fund, the ask as an investor in domestic players is a bit more, which means that Shalini spends a lot of time with the legal support to ensure that all the deals and paperwork are in order. ##  **The road ahead** Shalini is excited about finding good entrepreneurs who are building solutions for India. \"India is one of the fastest-growing markets now, with rising internet penetration, payment and logistics getting better, and rising spend; there are enough interesting opportunities for investors to look at in all parts of India.\" She shares that over the last five months, 500 has closed four deals, including the likes of Spoyl and Niramai, and that two more are on the way. \"500 is a popular brand name in India for seed investments, and most companies reach out directly. Some deals are also coming through the founder and investor community.\" Between all the networking, travelling, and juggling deals, Shalini reads voraciously, to know the markets, companies, and new trends, and be on top of things. While she can always reach out to the 500 team to vet the tech a startup is using or the product that they have built, its market value has to be assessed by her. With a toddler a home, it's surprising how much travel and work Shalini gets through. When she advises women entrepreneurs as a mentor on work-life balance and networking, her inputs come from her own personal experiences from multi- tasking, and of course, as she says, \"Great support from family, from my husband, mother, and mother-in-law.\" ##  **More women VCs** According to Shalini, if her tribe is to grow, more and more women entrepreneurs need to join the fray in the startup ecosystem. She says that it is imperative that women are able to identify themselves as belonging in a VC setup. \"We see women at the associate level, but not at a partner level, and that needs to change.\" She points out that, today, the venture capital industry is mostly male dominated, similar to how medicine and engineering were 25-30 years ago. \"Although VC firms want women on their team, there are fewer women thinking about this as a career option. More awareness about the VC industry and creating role models may help the tribe grow,\" Shalini says.

In January, 500 Startups had said that it was putting its plan to raise a $25-million India-focused fund on hold due to regulatory and tax issues. However, the seed-stage investor is not pulling out of India and has continued to make investments in Indian start-ups through its global fund, said Shalini Prakash, who leads investments and strategy for 500 Startups in India. \u201cMaybe at some point later in the year we will think about (the India fund)\u2014it could be 3 months or 6 months or 9 months from now,\" said Prakash in an interview. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be rushing into anything right now...We just want to make sure that we\u2019re supporting our founders\u2019 network very well and we want to ensure that they\u2019re getting what they want. We want to keep looking for interesting companies and keep investing in India\u2014that\u2019s our focus right now. But hopefully at some point we will re-think and start the conversation on how we want to do more in India,\" she said A separate fund would allow 500Startups\u2014which was launched by veteran Silicon Valley angel investor Dave McClure in 2010\u2014to do more seed-stage investments in India. Since December, 500Startups has invested in at least seven early- stage Indian start-ups through its global funds, including Spoyl, an online marketplace for pre-owned apparel, and Niramai, a healthcare-tech venture. The fund has also just closed an investment in Internet-of-things start-up Stellapps, alongside other investors such as Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal and Blume Ventures. \u201cThe only reason the fund would be more interesting for us is because we can do more investments in India. With a $25-million fund, we would look to do at least 100-150 companies in a matter of a few years,\" said Prakash, who has also worked with Kyron Accelerator and GSF Accelerator in the past. 500 Startups hopes to invest in at least a dozen start-ups by the end of the year, and is closing \u201cat least one deal every month\", said Prakash. So far, 500 Startups has backed at least 60 early-stage start-ups in India till date, including start-ups such as payments venture Instamojo. The Silicon Valley-based investor has also got exits from five Indian start-ups till date, including ZipDial, which was acquired by Twitter in 2015. \u201cWe did an investment in December\u2014we were feeling really bad that we were missing out on so much in India because there was not too much that we did last year, since we were raising the fund,\" she said. \u201cWe are on our way to close almost seven (investments)\u2014hopefully all of them will close by the end of this month. We typically do up to $150,000 with the first cheque, after which there may be follow on investments.\" Globally 500 Startups has invested in over 1,000 start-ups. Its first investment was in July 2010 in a social marketing software company called Wildfire which was later acquired by Google for $350 million. In an interview in February 2013, McClure had said that 500 Startups typically gets successful exits from about \u201c10-20%\" of its portfolio companies. Prakash also clarified that tax issues were not the only reason why 500 Startups had put its India-fund plans on hold last November. \u201cTax issues were not the primary reason\u2014we also sort of wanted to re-look at our strategy for India. While those conversations (at the time) were going really well, there was also a lot of uncertainty at the time, what with Brexit and the Trump election. So, we thought there was no rush in setting up the India fund\u2014we wanted to figure out the strategy (for India) because all the investments that we\u2019ve made in India so far have come from our global fund. So, we decided to continue doing what we were doing in India and figure out how we want to re-start India..because the goal is to do more in India, no matter what channel it comes from,\" said Prakash.

McClure is the latest venture capitalist to be ensnared in the industry\u2019s investigations into alleged sexual misconduct by investors with women that they were supposed to be mentoring or backing financially or simply professionally. News of McClure\u2019s departure was first reported by The New York Times. Since revelations of sexual misconduct at the venture capital firm Binary Capital (by its co-founder Justin Caldbeck) first appeared at the Information, basically unraveling the firm, other women entrepreneurs have come forward to share their own stories of harassment (and in some cases, assault). Chris Sacca, another storied investor whose early bets in companies like Uber have made him a millionaire several times over, was also brought up in _The Times\u2019_ report. Sacca, who stepped away from investing earlier in the year, issued what amounts to a public apology in a Medium post earlier today for his behavior. Sacca writes: > \u2026as more and more brave women have come forward to share their own tales and experiences from the hostile environment of the tech world, it has become clear to me there is a much bigger underlying issue in this industry, and I am realizing at times I was a part of that. > > Over the last week, I have spoken with friends, friends of friends, heard from people from my past including stories of how I\u2019d behaved, and read incredibly thoughtful and courageous essays. I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s often the less obvious, yet pervasive and questionable, everyday behaviors of men in our industry that collectively make it inhospitable for women. > > Listening to these stories, and being reminded of my past, I now understand I personally contributed to the problem. > > I am sorry. While Sacca has stepped away from investment, his former partner, Matt Mazzeo, had jumped over to Binary Capital and had been planning to join the firm as a partner before allegations there unraveled the firm. Meanwhile, here\u2019s the statement from 500 Startups\u2019 new chief executive, Christine Tsai, about the changes there: > In recent months, we found out that my co-founder Dave McClure had inappropriate interactions with women in the tech community. His behavior was unacceptable and not reflective of 500\u2019s culture and values. I sincerely apologize for the choices he made and the pain and stress they\u2019ve caused people. But apologies aren\u2019t enough without meaningful actions and change. > > Because of this, we made the decision a few months ago to change the leadership structure at 500. I took on the role of CEO, which involves directing the Management Team and overall day-to-day operations of 500. > > Dave\u2019s role has been limited to fulfilling his obligations to our investors as a General Partner. In addition, he\u2019s been attending counseling to work on changing his perspectives and preventing his previous unacceptable behavior. > > The actions we took weren\u2019t easy, but it was critical to us that we uphold our culture and values \u2013 even if it meant asking my co-founder to step aside in order for 500 to grow stronger. > > That said, I\u2019ll echo what many are already saying. As much as we want to be part of the solution, we clearly have also been part of the problem. Undoubtedly there are ways I could have done more or acted sooner. > > The change I want to see is a startup environment where everyone, regardless of gender and background feels welcome and safe. Where sexual harassment or discrimination will not impede great talent from producing great impact. > > How do we make this change happen? How can we be that change we want to see? > > It starts with me, and the work 500 started on and will continue to do. I am far from perfect, and 500 is far from perfect.

", "time": 1498780800, "value": 0}, {"text": "The sexual harassment scandal that has led to the official resignation of founding partner Dave McClure from 500 Startups raises the question of what kind of future the firm can have without him. It doesn\u2019t appear 500 Startups is off to a very good start in terms of handling the situation, which became public last Friday as part of a larger _New York Times_ story about sexual harassment in Silicon Valley. A blog post on June 30 from CEO Christine Tsai said management changes had been made and that McClure had stepped out of daily operations as the charges came to light. Then McClure wrote a long apology that seemed to draw mix reactions. But the stories they told about the timeline and disclosures didn\u2019t sync with the account of partner Elizabeth Yin, according to an email obtained by TechCrunch. Yin resigned as other accusations of harassment against McClure surfaced, notably in a blog post by entrepreneur Cheryl Yeoh. The acceleration of the story culminated in McClure officially resigning while also pleading with the larger startup community to not turn its back on 500 Startups. Though nobody thinks 500 Startups is going to collapse overnight, the manner of McClure\u2019s departure still raises the question of whether the firm can survive over time in the wake of this controversy. The answer matters tremendously because of the size and reach of the firm McClure started in 2010. Its team page lists 63 people in roles ranging from the three managing partners to local and regional venture partners around the world. And the company says it has a total staff of 150. In terms of its investments, the firm has a massive footprint now, and it\u2019s those founders who find themselves caught in the middle. 500 Startups runs a series of startup programs and accelerators, but it has also invested $350 million into 1,800 startups through four funds and 13 micro funds. Those companies are no doubt wondering what all this means to them in terms of reputation and association. At the same time, founders around the world will now have to carefully determine whether there is a risk in applying for one of these programs or seeking investment from the firm. And while a great deal of money is already committed, 500 Startups is going to have to prove to future investors that it has managed to separate itself both operationally and also reputationally from McClure. That latter will be a particular challenge, because as McClure likes to say, his value and 500 Startups\u2019 value both lay in their vast connections and mentoring relationships. The firm will now find out just how strong some of those ties are and how much they transcend McClure\u2019s star power and long reach. Because, despite the size of 500 Startups, from the outside it still certainly seemed like McClure was at the center of the firm and was very much its public face. Just last year, I interviewed him twice on stage at the Web Summit in Lisbon. He\u2019s been on a reality TV show, is a ubiquitous presence at conferences, and is one of the most quotable figures in Silicon Valley for journalists. I first personally interviewed him when I was a reporter at the _San Jose Mercury News_ for a story that named him one of the 10 most influential people in Silicon Valley. In an email interview at the time, before he formally started 500 Startups, I asked him to explain what he did because he seemed to be doing so many things. At the time, this included running an investment fund for Facebook and investing like mad as an angel, thanks to a windfall from his time at PayPal. \u201cI aim to combine all the things I do in a comprehensive and holistic fashion that benefits startups and the people who make them grow,\u201d he wrote. He built 500 Startups around that philosophy and it had succeeded perhaps beyond even his wildest fantasies.

According to reports in The Globe and Mail and BetaKit, the saga made it difficult to move forward with the next phase of 500 Canada, where it had a profit-sharing relationship. The firm was in the process of raising a $30 million fund, having already closed an initial $15 million commitment, but it is reported to have received pushback from LPs who were concerned that McClure would still be involved. Sources told BetaKit that this feedback from investors led to a renegotiation of the terms between 500 Startups  and 500 Startups Canada, principally around the removal of McClure\u2019s presence within the fund. With no agreement reached, it was decided that the fund would be disbanded, Betakit reported. 500 Startups provided us with the following statement: > \u201cWe remain bullish on Canada\u2019s startup ecosystem and deal flow. It\u2019s why we invested in Canada before the 500 Canada fund, and why we will continue to do so going forward.

Two weeks after the closure of its Canada-based fund, its maiden venture in Australia is getting the chop before it even began. The U.S. firm doesn\u2019t have a dedicated fund in Australia, but it did announce an accelerator program \u2014 500 Melbourne \u2014 in May in partnership with LaunchVic, a $60 million entrepreneurship scheme backed by the government of Victoria, Australia\u2019s second most populous state. Now, however, LaunchVic has terminated its partnership with the VC firm. The relationship had certainly gotten tense over the past month, since McClure resigned from 500 Startups in early July after a number of women came forward with sexual harassment allegations against him. LaunchVic put the firm \u201con notice\u201d last month after it was kept in the dark over the claims against McClure, who had traveled to Australia to front the launch of 500 Melbourne despite the fact that he had taken a back seat at the firm following an internal investigation into the claims. LaunchVic  said it wanted to see a \u201cchange in culture\u201d at the firm if the project was to go ahead, but the final straw seems to have been the resignation of 500 Melbourne head Rachael Neumann. Neumann quit the firm because she believes that \u201cthis is simply not the right time for 500 to launch in Australia.\u201d She explained on Twitter that she had traveled to the U.S. to meet with 500 Startups\u2019 leadership over its Australia plan, but following discussions made a decision to leave. \u201cWhile I am deeply disappointed at how this has ended, I feel confident in LaunchVic\u2019s strong course of action over the past month to give 500 Startups an opportunity to show leadership to improve culture in the startup sector and fix the issues at hand,\u201d LaunchVic CEO Dr Kate Cornick said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, as we\u2019ve expressed to 500 Startups, that without Rachael Neumann at the   helm we don\u2019t believe it will work,\u201d Dr Cornick added. \u201c500 strongly believes in the future of the Australian tech sector, but now is not the right time to move forward with this new partnership. We look forward to future opportunities down the road,\u201d a spokesperson for 500 Startups said via email. The dissolving of the partnership won\u2019t impact LaunchVic\u2019s overall budget. A representative of the organization clarified to TechCrunch that the grant of over $2 million that it originally pledged to 500 Melbourne will not be allocated to the project or 500 Startups itself. LaunchVic will instead use the grant to develop a different accelerator project that maintains links to the global and local startup community.

It is normal for VC firms to work closely with big corporates as LPs that supply money for their funds \u2014 the Middle East has proven to be fertile hunting ground for the likes of 500, Uber and Softbank \u2014 but direct investment in parents is not common in VC-land. ADFG has been an LP with 500 for some time and Christine Tsai, who heads the VC firm up, said there is \u201cstrong alignment on vision and complementary strengths\u201d between the two. Founded in 2011, ADFG claims to have $6 billion in assets under management via offices in the UAE, UK and Eastern Europe.

The firm\u2019s 23rd batch of startups this year consists of the usual mix of business to business and consumer companies (even coffee) that end up in each class. This class is definitely a smaller one, but it still seems to spread a pretty wide number of different verticals. There\u2019s also, of course, a blockchain track for this class, though a small percentage of the startups in it are taking part of that \u2014 and there was still a certain rigor they had to have to run through it. \u201cFor every major tech movement, for every tech phase, there\u2019s the infrastructure phase and the deployment phase,\u201d 500 Startups partner Marvin Laio said. \u201cOur view, with the blockchain, we\u2019re in the infrastructure phase. A lot of these projects outside that we see and read about, they\u2019re kind of bad. They\u2019re really applications. There\u2019s no point having a mobile app if you don\u2019t have the app store. You need to build out the app store. For better or worse, we\u2019re in the infrastructure phase right now.\u201d The firm is still clearly making some pretty big changes, including an unconventional deal with the Abu Dhabi Financial Group (ADFG) that gives it a stake in the firm\u2019s parent company. The terms of that deal weren\u2019t disclosed, it was another move among many by CEO Christine Tsai to begin to rework the mechanics of how the firm works \u2014 especially as it hopes to succeed as both a venture fund as as a program for entrepreneurs looking to get their companies off the ground. Dave McClure, the firm\u2019s co-founder, resigned last year following allegations of sexual misconduct, and since then it\u2019s been trying to get back to business as usual. 500 Startups takes a similar approach to other accelerators, where they will invest around $150,000 for a small chunk of equity and then take on a small amount of that back (a little more than $37,000) for program fees. The firm has primarily been known for its savvy when it comes to growth and marketing, so the support entrepreneurs get usually has that as a core part of the experience.

Following shortly in the wake of allegations of 500 Startups founder Dave McClure\u2019s sexual misconduct and resignation, 500 Canada\u2019s dreams of closing a $30 million fund were dashed when target LPs informed the fund in July 2017 they would not make an investment if McClure continued to exercise any form of control or receive economic benefit from 500\u2019s Canada Fund. > In addition to winding down Canada Fund follow-on investments, Khera has joined 500 Startups as a partner and will lead activity in Canada.   > 500 Canada has remained out of the spotlight since then, but that doesn\u2019t mean it stopped. In fact, speaking with Neha Khera, a partner at 500 Canada, the fund has been quite active. While the halt on net-new investments remains intact, Khera said the fund has made three follow-on commitments to its portfolio companies since October, and hopes to support about 20 percent of the 500 Canada portfolio (36 companies in all). \u201cA large part of my job now is deploying that follow-on money,\u201d she said. At the time of 500 Canada\u2019s announcement last July, the managing partners had indicated that the fund would make no follow-on investing, but Khera told BetaKit that \u201cwe didn\u2019t quite know where the budgets all stood, so we didn\u2019t want to make any rash announcements about being able to follow-on.\u201d Since then, 500 Canada\u2019s investment committee has done the work to figure out how much it could allocate to support, and has been actively working to connect its portfolio with new investors. While Khera indicated that about 50 percent of 500 Canada\u2019s investments have raised follow-on funding, she explained that the next 12-18 months are a \u201ccritical phase\u201d to support a young portfolio. \u201cWe all thought it was important someone stay on more than part- time,\u201d she said. Although that investment committee talks \u201calmost every day,\u201d the reality is that rest of the Canada Fund team has moved on, many to Panache Ventures. A new $25 million fund launched in March of this year, Panache in many ways looks to replicate the 500 Canada model, including providing deal flow and co- investing with 500 Startups. \u201cIt\u2019s basically the same agreement on that part of the seed program that we had with 500 Canada,\u201d Panache partner (and former 500 Canada partner) David Dufresne told BetaKit. ![500 Canada team](https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy- load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)![500 Canada team](https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/canada-team- final-1024x505.jpg) The 500 Canada team, with Dave McClure [center], Neha Khera [2nd from right], and David Dufresne [left].

That also meant joining an organization at the forefront of tech\u2019s #metoo reckoning. On this point, Khera was clear in her motivation. \u201cAfter the summer, it was an intense four to six months for [500 US] to reorganize,\u201d she said. \u201c[500 US] took it as an opportunity to hit reset and say, \u2018okay, who are we going to be going forward\u2019 and commit to that. When I made the decision to join it was a time of flux, but I think the company has come out way stronger than it was before.\u201d While McClure\u2019s removal helped (per a spokesperson, McClure \u201cno longer has any control or governance over 500\u2019s management or operations,\u201d but continues to hold a minority stake in 500), Khera indicated that visits to 500 US while considering a role as a 500 Canada partner convinced her of the \u201cemphasis it put on diversity within its own boundaries.\u201d \u201cBeing a woman in tech I never felt uncomfortable, even after the company came in the spotlight,\u201d Khera continued, noting that conversations with 500 Startups co-founder and now CEO, Christine Tsai, cemented the decision. \u201cAlthough it had problems with one guy, the organization was living and breathing diversity.\u201d In terms of leading direct investments and rebuilding a national team on the ground in Canada, Khera remained mum on specifics, stating that \u201cit\u2019s too early to say.\u201d Some notable pieces of information that will allow you to draw your own conclusions: Khera is expecting her second child and will be soon going on maternity leave, putting plans on hold (in the short term); 500 Startups recently announced a strategic investment from Abu Dhabi Financial Group (ADFG), which it says will \u2018\u201caccelerate the growth of our key initiatives, expand into new markets, and anchor future 500 funds\u201d; it\u2019s been about two years since 500 Startups closed its 4th fund; the gap between Fund III and Fund IV was about a year. Hmm. Maybe it\u2019s a good sign for Canadian tech that 500 Startups is starting to cut larger follow-on cheques. Regardless of the means, \u201c500 Startups still believes in Canada and this is how we\u2019re going to continue to support it,\u201d Khera said.

When it comes to growing a business, seed investors can provide you with capital, network, expertise, and support. Seed capital will help you not just take the business off the ground, but also help your company scale and take it to new heights. It provides a competitive advantage in all ways that matter \u2013 hiring key staff, resources, business development, marketing, and sales. The process of fundraising is long, complex, and exhaustive. Nevertheless, it is a path almost all companies and founders must walk. Think you want to raise venture capital? Here are five \u2018T\u2019s that most seed investors/VCs look for before considering making an investment: ![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/wordpress/2018/06/Fund- Raise.png?fm=png&auto=format) ##  **Target problem** Every founder needs to know \u201cwhat is the problem they\u2019re trying to solve,\u201d and \u201cif it\u2019s a problem waiting for a solution\u201d. This problem is felt by a specific group of consumers or businesses. One key aspect that needs to be described and understood is the gap between the current state and the target state in clear and measurable terms, revenue potential, and if the market is big for it. ##  **Team** The success of a startup hinges on the team\u2019s mentality for innovating on existing ideas to solve critical pain points, inherent qualities like hustle, perseverance, leadership style, etc., and their execution capability. ##  **Technology** The problem/pain point stated can only be solved with technology. The choice of technology has to be a pragmatic one rather than based on preferences and trends. In addition, technology should help businesses scale and increase efficiency. ##  **Traction** Traction denotes validation of the product or service in the market. Once your customer has no vested interest in your company's success and decides to spend money, time, and resources, it is indicative that you are getting traction. Remember, short sales-cycle and scaling the product should be easy to achieve immediate traction. ##  **Timing** The founders need to do a reality check to see if the market or customer is ready for the product or service. We have heard many success stories like Airbnb and Uber \u2013 a big part of their success is attributed to the timing of their launch. Strike too early or too late, and you risk striking out. Factors that are important for an entrepreneur to consider before reaching out to investors are \u2018Investor fit\u2019. This matters particularly while raising a seed round, as they play a role in future rounds of raising capital. To ensure there is value and personality fit, it is a good practice to speak to other entrepreneurs in their portfolio and get their feedback. Be sure you know what domains or sectors your investor is focused on. Knowing this is important, as it defines an investment and partnership fit. In sum, if you are looking for a VC or angel investor capital, be sure that your product and business is investor-ready. Once you have everything in place, you can tailor your investment pitch by adding the other things that angel investors are looking for, as outlined above.  _Shalini Prakash is a Venture Partner at 500Startups where she heads India investments and portfolio._  _(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)_ ", "time": 1529452800, "value": 0}, {"text": "Christine Tsai skipped the Beyonc\u00e9 shout-out. The co-founder and CEO of 500 Startups, a San Francisco accelerator that helped propel successes like Twilio and Talkdesk, smiled firmly as she deftly reeled off statistics before a crowd of investors and entrepreneurs. In front of a packed room in the Westfield San Francisco Centre last month, she explained how her company plans to \u201cdiscover and back the world\u2019s most talented entrepreneurs.\u201d She was kicking off Demo Day, the 8-year-old company\u2019s introduction of the latest batch of startups it funds, promotes and advises. The stage presentation was a far cry from a year ago, when Tsai\u2019s co-founder, Dave McClure, pranced in wearing a Queen of Hearts gown and a curly red wig, name- dropping Beyonc\u00e9 as he introduced the year\u2019s batch. And that was classic McClure. His in-your-face presence, marked with swear words and self-deprecating jokes, defined 500 Startups\u2019 early days and won it vital attention. Company founders and partners often dressed in costume during 500 pitch sessions, a defiantly distinct air from the serious tone of other startup events. Some made Macklemore-inspired music videos. Push-up challenges were common at the office. And just when it seemed like Silicon Valley might be tapped out, McClure took the buzz global through his Geeks on a Plane tours, which visited Asia, Africa and other spots in the hunt for more startups to back. McClure\u2019s trash talk and quirkiness set him apart from run-of-the-mill, fleece-vest-wearing venture capitalists. But he also epitomized the scrappy Silicon Valley hustler who mixes work and socializing. After women went public last summer with allegations that McClure sexually harassed them, McClure\u2019s line-crossing behavior turned from an asset to a hindrance. He was one more example of a well-connected man abusing his position of power for personal gain, and the revelations were a #MeToo moment for tech. Admitting that he took advantage of women who approached him for employment or investment, he labeled himself a \u201ccreep\u201d and left the company. Now 500 Startups, under Tsai, is trying to find its footing. Like many companies that lost executives after charges of harassment or assault, the accelerator has been forced to re-evaluate its ambitions while making crucial changes. The class that went through the accelerator this spring had only 18 companies, half the size of recent classes. It skipped a class of startups last winter, and stopped hosting companies in Mountain View, its longtime headquarters, consolidating its efforts in a newer San Francisco office. The company has taken action to reform itself. It instituted a harassment policy and hotline. And it joined a group of investors who promised to disclose plans to provide harassment-free workplaces. That movement, known as #MovingForward, is spearheaded by Cheryl Yeoh Sew Hoy, the founder of a 500-backed startup and one of the women who accused McClure of harassment. The firm is eager to move forward. But as 500\u2019s co-founder, McClure reportedly still holds a stake in the firm. Sew Hoy, while acknowledging that 500 has signed her pledge, says she is disappointed by the company\u2019s silence about what happened to her. And two high-profile partners have left. Silicon Valley thrives on embracing the new. Dogged by its #MeToo moment, can a startup factory transcend its past? * * * An accelerator, as the name suggests, tries to speed startups to success by housing them together with other ventures, advisers and investors under the same roof. In exchange for a piece of each startup \u2014 typically 6 percent\u2014 500 Startups puts the founders it backs through a series of training programs, culminating in the all-important Demo Day, where investors are keenly watching. Work, play and networking unfold in close quarters \u2014 it\u2019s like a summer camp for nerds, but with booze and far higher stakes. McClure ran an e-commerce company in the mid-\u201990s before working at startups like PayPal and becoming a venture capitalist. During the first dot-com bubble, an idealized mashup of work, play and making money took shape in San Francisco. Internet pioneers lived and worked under the same roof, putting in long hours as they built the world\u2019s first websites. \u201cNow it\u2019s like 80-hour weeks are not uncommon \u2026 if you\u2019re giving up that much of your personal life, there better be some payback, not just in the long term, but even in the short term,\u201d McClure told social anthropologist Jenny Cool, a University of Southern California professor who studied him and others in his web-connected circle, in 1996. \u201cThere still has to be a component of their lives which fulfills that socialization need and I think there\u2019s a great amount of power in being able to tie that into a work environment.\u201d What McClure\u2019s vision didn\u2019t account for was the way the power and influence he wielded would grow. Over the past two decades, the money flowing into San Francisco startups grew nearly twentyfold, from $1 billion in 1996 to $18.6 billion in 2016, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. In 2012, McClure groused at a startup conference that he had spent five to seven years building Aslan Computing, which he sold for less than $1 million. The founders he backed see the promise of faster and bigger payoffs: 500 Startups writes initial checks for $150,000 to the startups it backs, with more to come if they perform well at Demo Day. Twilio, backed by 500 in 2010, is now worth $5.6 billion. By his own admission, McClure took advantage of this status. In June 2017, the New York Times reported that he told Sarah Kunst, an entrepreneur who was seeking a job with his firm, \u201cI was getting confused figuring out whether to hire you or hit on you.\u201d McClure, then CEO, was removed from his management role after an investigation, the company said at the time. Shortly afterward, Sew Hoy, whom 500 Startups had backed, came forward with accusations that McClure forced himself on her. \u201cIn real life, McClure is kind of awkward and shy, but he realized how powerful he was \u2014 and he took advantage of it and abused it without really knowing,\u201d Sew Hoy told The Chronicle. McClure did not respond to a request for comment. \u201cI made advances towards multiple women in work-related situations,\u201d McClure wrote in a 2017 blog post apologizing for behavior that, he said, \u201churt or offended several women.\u201d Sew Hoy\u2019s experience, which took place in her apartment in Malaysia, where McClure was visiting some of the startups he had backed, highlighted the informal ties that abound in tech. She had sold her startup to Walmart and was helping 500 Startups raise a Southeast Asian fund. She wasn\u2019t an employee, and McClure wasn\u2019t her boss. Unlike a big company, there was no human resources department to go to. \u201cPolicies are policies, but if they\u2019re never executed, they\u2019re pointless,\u201d said Sew Hoy, who says the #MovingForward initiative has been signed by 107 organizations. \u201cI think it speaks a lot to their commitment. If they don\u2019t speak about it, it\u2019s as if they\u2019re hiding something or they don\u2019t take it seriously enough, especially if they\u2019ve had an incident happen before.\u201d * * * In many senses, 500 Startups under Tsai is a quieter place. For some, it\u2019s too quiet. Partner Elizabeth Yin left shortly after the revelations about McClure\u2019s behavior last year, citing \u201ca lack of transparency and several untruths\u201d in how management handled his departure. Some of McClure\u2019s victims, too, question whether Tsai did enough to rein her co-founder in. Monique Woodard, the firm\u2019s first African American partner, left in January. In an oblique blog post about her departure, she wrote that she had to \u201clet go of the old things\u201d but was \u201crooting for Christine Tsai.\u201d Even with those departures, 500\u2019s lineup of partners is notable for including far more women and people of color than most venture capital firms. McClure championed diverse hiring at the firm. And no incidents of harassment or other unwelcome conduct have emerged since McClure\u2019s departure. After the allegations against McClure became public, Tsai called his actions \u201cunacceptable and not reflective of 500\u2019s culture and values.\u201d She has said little about it since then. In an interview with The Chronicle on Demo Day last month, Tsai showed little interest in discussing McClure, alternating glances at her phone screen and a PR representative standing nearby. She declined to answer specific questions, including the allegations that she knew about past incidents of harassment. \u201cIt was important to have honest conversations, and that\u2019s what we did,\u201d Tsai said, in her only comment about the events of the past year. * * * Young companies continue to flock to 500 Startups, citing its expansive network. The advice and training, some say, is priceless. \u201cIt used to be that no one thought of a coffee company as a tech company,\u201d said Debbie Wei Mullin, founder of Copper Cow Coffee, one of the companies in 500 Startups\u2019 latest group. \u201cBut through 500, we met mentors that helped us get crash courses in all aspects of the business, like technical distribution strategies.\u201d Mullin added that the startups in the group also helped each other by offering advice or making introductions. Rami Alame, CEO of Lexyom, a company from Lebanon enrolled in 500 Startups, said that in addition to the workshops, the diversity of the group added value to the experience. For now, 500\u2019s latest startups, which are still scrapping to make a name for themselves and attract investors, are more worried about their own futures than the accelerator\u2019s past. Kris Rudeegraap, CEO of Sendoso, which was in the accelerator\u2019s first group after McClure\u2019s departure, said he felt the company addressed the scandal honestly, as did Jeremy Huff, CEO of Purple Go, a member of the most recent batch. Alame said the McClure scandal was simply not on his mind when he applied to 500. \u201cWhen a company is knocked down to some degree, it\u2019s another opportunity to pick yourself back up and do a great job, to prove yourself and prove your value,\u201d said Bruno Wong, CEO of Orchard, a startup in the most recent group. \u201cI knew that the batch I was entering was one of those opportunities for 500 Startup to push hard and show the world how they can be resilient.\u201d McClure, once a prolific blogger, has limited his social media output in the past year, mostly to retweets of posts about politics and startups. But in March, he posted a personal reflection, one that recalled his search for comrades and companions in the earliest days of the internet. \u201cThe primary attribute of Silicon Valley is not tech, finance or entrepreneurship. It\u2019s just being really f\u2014ing #awkward. (For those of us who feel that way all the time, it\u2019s called home :)\u201d To some, that may read as a further apology. To others, it\u2019s an excuse. \u201cThis community is a lot of awkward dudes who didn\u2019t have attention in high school or college, and they suddenly get attention\u201d because they\u2019re a hot shot venture capitalist, Sew Hoy said. That attention breeds confusion, and eventually, an abuse of power, she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where it turns from gray into black.\u201d __ _Natasha Mascarenhas is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

There are new companies built in every garage, but how can one ensure high user engagement, retention, and expansion, and avoid the hazards caused by every wave of new media or platform adoption? Every industry has its critical value drivers. But the first step is to think systematically about it, and understand that engagement requires a set of building blocks that will feed into the critical value drivers. Engagement platforms (as described by Mark Bonchek) are built from **multiple engagement layers** working together.   * The identity layer recognizes the customer.   * The data layer exchanges information to personalize the experience.   * The relationship layer enables connection among the brand and community members.   * The value layer delivers benefits to the users. ![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/wordpress/2018/08/Billion- users.jpg?fm=png&auto=format) Image: Shutterstock Initial models naturally gravitated towards \u201cpure-play\u201d platforms like Paytm and Flipkart that focussed mostly on commerce. But this value chain has to broaden to engage with a wider audience whose primary motivation to come on the platform is different. Some successful companies that realised and adopted these strategies much later are Apple\u2019s iTunes Music Manager, the Nike+ running community, etc. In the forthcoming years, we will see platforms built with \u201cnetwork effect\u201d-first engagement models that have a wider audience reach before commerce comes to play. For example, Kickstarter was built around collaboration, Pinterest was built around curation, etc. ##  **Pull pull pull** Users don\u2019t like to be pushed. The engagement models should be weaved into the product or platform, such that it \u201cpulls\u201d the customer to itself. Several companies like Google or Facebook are using the **pull** strategy to engage. Platforms that have the ability to create a gravitational field and attract customers into their brand orbit and drive engagement will eventually become successful. > The types of engagement strategies that are particularly common include connection, content, curation, conversation, collaboration, contribution, and commerce. Indian startups building communities for 1,000,000,000 are mostly centred around these models. Take for example Sharechat for conversation, Vokal for collaboration, POPxo for content, etc. These platforms will be built to engage with customers outside the purchase process, and deliver value beyond the products being sold. The goal is to keep the customers in frequent orbit around the brand, and make it easy for customers to purchase a product or a service. > By defining the kind of relationship, companies can create greater engagement, differentiation, and loyalty. Research shows that companies with platform- and network-based business models create higher value. These models have proven to grow faster, be more profitable, and be more valued than companies organized around products and services. As you embark on your network journey, it is vital to understand the value in a network is about what (or who) you connect \u2013 not what your product or service is.  _Disclaimer: POPxo and Vokal are

", "time": 1536537600, "value": 0}, {"text": "Matt Lerner, who has for the last few years effectively been 500 Startups\u2019 main person in London, is reducing his role at the Silicon Valley-based VC fund and accelerator to pursue a new business of his own. He\u2019s officially scaling back to a part-time position of Venture Partner to launch \u201cgrowth coaching\u201d company Heretix. The idea, he tells me, is to build on his work running the 500 Startups London \u201cDistro Dojo\u201d growth marketing program, but in a way that opens it up to more startups in the U.K. and across Europe that are in need of building a self- sufficient growth strategy. That\u2019s because any company is free to approach Heretix, which is initially acting as a simple gun for hire (although you still need to apply) and, unlike Distro Dojo, isn\u2019t a program tied to an equity investment. \u201cWe\u2019re not an agency, and we\u2019re not a bootcamp,\u201d says Lerner, who will continue to head up 500 Startups\u2019 London office and support its U.K. portfolio. \u201cHeretix is focused on providing growth coaching for startup founders and teams. Our first goal is to help them double, triple or 10x their growth. Our second goal is to make them self-sufficient.\u201d. To provide further context, Lerner says to think back to 2015 when he left PayPal to join 500 Startups in London, a city that wasn\u2019t short of accelerators but was facing a \u201cSeries A Crunch\u201d. \u201cThe capital was there, and so were the seed-stage startups. So what was the problem?\u201d he says. The answer: VCs could not find enough investable companies with Series A traction. \u201cThrough my work at 500, I saw a ton of seed-stage companies who were able to hustle themselves to mid-five-figure MRR.. But they would flatten out, their hustle would not scale. They could not find the multiple repeatable channels they needed to break through the \u00a3100,000 monthly revenue barrier\u201d. In an attempt to solve this problem, 500 Startups decided to launch a growth marketing investment program, and based on his experience building B2B growth teams for PayPal, tapped up Lerner to run it. The resulting \u201cDistro Dojo\u201d was a program with a mandate to help post-seed companies scale growth on top of existing traction. \u201cI set up the Dojo and was lucky enough to get some very talented entrepreneurs and marketers to join me. And, it really made a difference,\u201d says Lerner. \u201cWe worked with 35 companies, and earned a \u2018Net Promoter\u2019 score of 96 percent from our founders. And their companies saw an average growth of 250 percent year-on-year with many companies growing revenue 3x, 5x, even 20x. And many of them have raised at higher valuations, including AirSorted, ZenJob, Tamatem, Popsa, Settled and OurPath\u201d. To that end, in combination with other members of the original Dojo team, Heretix sees its official unveiling today, with a mission to help companies grow without being tied to outside agencies or consultants. That\u2019s because Lerner believes that you can\u2019t ultimately outsource growth, it has to be an \u201cinternal muscle\u201d you develop as a founder and as a company. \u201cThe 500 Distro Dojo helped us prove out the model, and now we want to offer that coaching to promising startups all over Europe, without taking equity\u201d adds Lerner. \u201cOur program has two formats: our half-day \u2018Quick Wins\u2019 workshop and a \u2018Core Strengths\u2019 program that runs part-time for two months.\u201d ", "time": 1539043200, "value": 0}, {"text": "# Real estate investment platform Smart Crowd closes $600,000 seed funding round Smart Crowd allows average investors to buy and sell share in properties with a minimum investment of AED5,000 Abdul Kadir Faizal, co-founder, COO, Siddiq Farid, founder, CEO, and Musfique Ahmed, co-founder, chief digital officer. Smart Crowd, the real estate crowd funding investment platform, closed a $600,000 seed funding round, having attracted financing from Shorooq Investments, Abaxx Technologies, 500 Start-ups and other individual investors. The firm will use the funds to accelerate its growth and invest in its technology, according to co-founder Siddiq Farid. Smart Crowd allows average investors to buy and sell share in properties with a minimum investment of AED5,000, reducing the barriers to entry to low-middle income households to build financial assets. It also provides users with active management of their shares. While it currently operates under an Innovation Testing License (ITL) from Dubai\u2019s Financial Services Authority (DFSA), which allows only UAE residents to invest in Dubai properties, it plans on pursuing a full license which will enable anyone to invest anywhere in the world. Shane Shin, founding managing partner of Abu Dhabi-based Shorooq Investments said the platform has already \u201crevolutionised how real estate investments are done in mature markets like the US and Europe, influencing millions of peoples' lives and their real estate savings.\u201d VIDEO Mahmoud Adi, Shorooq\u2019s founding partner, added that Smart Crowd solves two underlying pain points in a real estate investment: the requirement of significant cash sums and the long holding period and illiquid market. \u201cBy enabling clients to invest in a property for as low as AED5,000, Smart Crowd is fulfilling people\u2019s dreams of investing in homes and encouraging everyone to start saving now versus waiting to get a huge amount of capital which can take decades,\u201d he said. Smart Crowd had won the Accenture Innovation Award at GITEX 2017, securing a place in the inaugural round of DIFC\u2019s Fintech Hive. It then went on to win the Sharjah Entrepreneurship Festival competition, becoming part of the Sharjah Entrepreneurship Centre (Sheraa's) incubator programme, as well as taking second place in the Smart Dubai Global Blockchain Challenge and eventually winning the Seedstar UAE contest.

And while many are a long way from becoming the next Uber or Airbnb, they are well worth keeping an eye on. For 2018, CNBC has quadrupled the size of the list, with the goal of discovering a more diverse group of companies that reveal key trends and new market opportunities that smart entrepreneurs are chasing with the new companies they are founding. In retail we see new ventures targeting changing shopping habits, as advanced e-commerce and logistics technology allows for more customization; in health care, telemedicine is taking off, with upstarts using mobile apps to connect doctors and patients in a wide array of disciplines, from balding to birth control; and in transportation and warehousing we see companies using robotics and autonomous vehicle technology to continue to change the way humans and machines work together. With 100 Upstarts instead of just 25, the list provides a broader picture of where venture capitalists are placing their bets on the future. As the IPO market heats up and the richest private start-ups begin to head for the exits, venture capitalists are making bigger bets on earlier-stage companies. According to PitchBook, early stage investing has risen for seven straight quarters, climbing to $11.5 billion in the second quarter of 2018, with an average deal size of $18 million. The early injections of large amounts of capital means there are hundreds of young companies around the world with the potential to become acquisition targets, unicorn start-ups or public companies. How we chose these 100 Upstarts More than 500 start-ups responded to our call for submissions, supplying information about the company's founders, investors, growth, recent milestones and more, some of it off the record. To be eligible, companies had to be privately held and founded no earlier than Jan. 1, 2013. Companies also must have been pre-Series B in their funding and have raised no more than $50 million. All eligible companies were then scored on eight equally-weighted quantitative metrics. The 100 highest-scoring eligible companies are our Upstarts. Here is a brief summary of each of the metrics that determined the Upstart 100.  **Scalability** Achieving scale is not just about being able to produce and distribute enough product to meet demand; it's also about having a workforce capable of servicing existing customers and acquiring new ones. The scalability score is based on company-provided responses to a group of questions about the ability to meet customer demand and the growth and size of the company's workforce.  **Sales growth** Based on company-provided sales numbers from 2016 and 2017, plus projected 2018 sales. Companies were asked to choose from a selection of ranges instead of providing exact numbers. Responses have been kept off the record because private companies are not required to make sales numbers public, and most would refuse to share sales numbers with CNBC if they thought we might publish them.  **User/customer growth** Companies gave an estimate of year-over-year user or customer growth. The companies were not asked to specify whether or not these were paying customers or users. Responses have been kept off the record.  **Workforce diversity** CNBC calculated a workforce diversity score based on company-provided answers to questions about certain demographic breakdowns of their employees and executives, including whether or not the company has a female founder and/or CEO.  **Access to capital and community** This metric helped ensure an even geographic distribution for the Upstart 100. Twenty-two of the nominees were the only companies nominated from a particular state (as happened in Arizona, Kansas and Maine, to name a few) or country (like Hungary, Indonesia and Norway). These companies received higher scores in this category than the 169 nominees from Silicon Valley or the 125 nominees from New York City.  **Intellectual property** A measure of whether or not the nominee company owns a patent, which can be a critical source of competitive advantage for a new venture. We made no attempt to judge the quality of the patents owned, nor did we give extra weight to companies with more patents than others. This was a zero-sum category. Source: Google Patents.  **Industry size and industry life-cycle stage** We researched each company's primary industry and, using IBISWorld's database of industry reports, determined the size of each industry (in U.S. dollars) and its life-cycle stage (growth, mature or decline). The score for these categories assumes that it's better to be a new venture in an industry that is large and growing than it is to be in one that is small and in decline. Special thanks also to PitchBook, which we used to help confirm company eligibility. Fundraising was a determining factor for the list itself.

By enabling clients to invest in a property for as low as AED5,000, Smart Crowd is fulfilling people\u2019s dreams of investing in homes and encouraging everyone to start saving now versus waiting to get a huge amount of capital which can take decades. We are confident the region now needs an innovative solution like Smart Crowd and is ready to wholeheartedly embrace this platform.\u201d Sharif El-Badawi, Partner at 500 Start-ups, said: \u201cSmart Crowd offers a much needed alternative through which investors large and small, experienced or novice, can crowdfund their projects, without the need for banks and large tickets. They enable a whole new class of real estate investors with smaller checks and higher volumes, which results in projects being funded faster and with full transparency. Perhaps more importantly, the technology behind Smart Crowd enables these investors to get into the real estate market with little hassle and allows them to generate residual and capital returns fairly quickly.\u201d The startup was part of first cohort of Abu-Dhabi based FinTech Hive and had also participated in the Sharjah-based Sheraa\u2019s acceleration program.

I plan weeks in advance when it comes to my meetings. I have been this way since childhood; I am very organised about things and ruthless about time. As an entrepreneur, you have to be present at the moment to be efficient and plan things ahead. When I got picked by an investment bank, I was suddenly thrown in with 70 hours of work a week. I was building financial models and creating presentations for top investors.  **There is something called contextual switching, where one should learn how to handle stressful moments and emotional intelligence**. For example, when I became an entrepreneur, I would meet my whole team on a Monday, on Wednesday I would meet the sales team and on Friday I would spend time talking about what we have achieved in the week.  **YS: Talk about your startup experience.**  **AA:** I founded Retargeter in 2009 in a small office and we solved targeted display ads through a platform-based approach. We raised a very small round and bootstrapped it to profitability. As a founder, you have to decide the metrics and communicate them well. I spent the first four years just focusing on that theme before we began to hit a big revenue run rate. The founding team is always closer to the founder, but as you get bigger, bring in new leaders. You need to create a space for feedback and as a founder, you need to be objective. You need processes and structures as you get bigger while the core values must remain. I built a sizeable organisation before we sold to SellPoints in 2015. It's also important for founders to know at what point they should sell a company and at what stage they have to bring in the right advisors.  **YS: What do you mean by right advisors?**  **AA:** Entrepreneurs should work with folks who have been in the ecosystem and have deep industry expertise. I am on the board of several companies, and I can tell you that advisors need to be involved in a startup\u2019s growth. You need mentors where there is no obligation to give stake but when you bring in an advisor the role is to make the startup grow to the next level.  **YS: How should startups handle working with employees as they grow?**  **AA:** Align incentives and ensure they are rewarded. There must be no mismatch in expectations. Founders should see talent and ensure they can perform their best. When you have reviewed don't surprise them with things that you never expected of them. That's why I would say that it is a process and everybody should know those processes. The founder values, the job description should be constantly communicated and work should be measured. In a high-performance team, one needs best practices, transparency, clear tasks and core values to guide employees. A founder should be open to firing people. I still remember the first person I fired, it was not easy. But there is a way to do it and it is always about communicating in the right way.  **YS: What advice do you give startups when they come and pitch to you?**  **AA** : What startups should do when they come to me? They have to tell me whether they are solving a real problem for a real set of customers. I am okay with people using buzzwords like AI, AR, blockchain and machine learning. But they have to tell me how they have solved a customer problem. You can always raise money from friends and family and go after some early customers. But raise money only after you have customer validation. I must also add that if you are doing pilots, do charge for them and learn how to price the pilots. Maybe you could discount the early product or charge a bonus when you create an outcome for the client. If you ask me about consumer companies, they have to solve a niche and scale very quickly. Most importantly, their pitch should communicate everything in one minute and thirty-six seconds. Now usually it's only two minutes that you get and if you have caught their attention you will get more time with them. There are too many pitches and introductions that a VC has to filter through and the entrepreneur should be on the money about their product and what it is solving. * * * ", "time": 1543190400, "value": 0}, {"text": "Digital recruiting platform for medical sector wins Romanian start-up competition Five Romanian start-ups received financing in the start-up competition that was part of this year\u2019s How to Web tech conference.

Especially in some of the more remote parts of the country. At the East Tech West conference in Nansha, Guangzhou, this week, business leaders, investors and experts contemplated how the country can effectively \"equalize\" these services for the whole nation. Indeed, the number of internet users in rural China stood at 209 million in 2017, around 30 percent of the total online population. This represents a good starting point for the tech industry, with established giants and start-ups trying to capitalize on key areas like education, health care and food production. Education Technology is being developed to give students in rural China more access to education via online learning platforms. This is because of a teacher shortage in remote and impoverished areas, according to a report by venture fund 500Startups, released in July this year. Chinese unicorn, VIPKid, launched the Rural Education Project in 2017, which aims to bring online education to 10,000 classrooms by live-streaming lessons. \"The limit is, as a platform, how we can maintain the highest quality possible where we are undergoing this rapid growth (and) how we can stay focused on quality and learning efficacy when we are learning with so many teachers,\" VIPKid CEO and co-founder Cindy Mi told CNBC Tuesday at East Tech West. This tech push in education comes after China's Education Ministry required governments at all levels to spend a minimum of 8 percent on digitalization of education, according to the report by 500Startups. It also noted that 55 million students in rural schools in China are now reachable by live-streaming classes. Health care Artificial intelligence (AI) is a major buzz word at any tech event these days, but at East Tech West there was a focus on how it could solve problems in industries like health care. Jim Wang, the CEO of health care conglomerate NovaVision Group, believes AI will level out the quality of care in the coming decades. He said it will likely close the gap between rural and urban parts of China. \"Over the last 30 to 40 years, not enough medical resources have been deployed (equally) ... There's a lot of mistreatment. Medical A.I. will smooth that over. For example, we can train A.I. to support the rural countryside medical doctors,\" he told CNBC. He also talked about screening for diseases from just one picture of an eye. ''In China, we don't have family doctors and a referral system. Everyone will go to the big hospitals, which is why big hospitals are very cramped, \" he explained. Thus he hoped A.I. would reduce the need for people to go to larger, urban hospitals. Catrinel Hagivreta, the founder and CEO at MEDIjobs, an A.I.-based recruitment start-up for the health care industry, explained to CNBC why China needs a radical solution like A.I.: \"Studies have shown that aging population is a huge problem for China, with one-in-three people being 60 years or older by 2050. On the other hand, in 2016 the Chinese government raised the limit on the number of births per family from one to two, which means more births and a population growth boom,\" she said via email. \"For the medical industry, those two factors indicate: a growing number of retiring health care specialists and a growing need for health care services \u2026 That requires a radical solution like A.I. for health care, which can better allocate resources to patients. Especially in the rural areas, technology like telemedicine is one of the few ways issues like this can be solved,\" she said. Meanwhile, Dan Wang, a technology analyst at macro research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, told CNBC via email he thinks A.I. can make an impact, but believes there's room for improvement. \"AI has the potential to significantly improve health-care technologies, especially in medical image processing. On the margin, however, I suspect that low-tech solutions are more important for transforming health care in China. There's still lots of room left to improve the basics of patient care and health administration,\" he said. Agriculture Further plans for China to incorporate A.I. in industry doesn't stop at health care. Edith Yeung, the head of 500 Startups in China, and the creator of The Chinese Internet Report, talked to CNBC about how it can also help farmers. \"Chinese food safety is a big issue, so you see, you know, Tencent and Alibaba both partner up with farmers to actually build the so-called A.I. pig, and chicken, to literally use IOT (the internet of things) devices to keep track of the vital signs, on pigs that we will eat, and make sure that food is safe. So, there are so many fun examples,'' she told CNBC. Alin Iftemi, the chief technology officer at Modex, in charge of blockchain and A.I. research and development, told CNBC that the Alibaba use case is an interesting one. But he added that the are many other better examples of how A.I. and the blockchain can help farming. \"Alibaba is focused on animal protection because the algorithm can predict eventual disease for the animals. But A.I. can drastically improve the agriculture costs in poor rural China in more ways,\" he told CNBC via email. \"For example, image processing A.I. algorithms can help drones determine affected harvests, low or high humidity areas and automatically trigger on the spot repair actions from devices like drones. Instead of wasting pesticides or water for an entire field, A.I. helps farmers use only how much is required, where it's required,\" he added. The challenges Despite the clear optimism and enthusiasm from business leaders, some analysts will still point out that changing rural China is a complex issue that won't happen overnight. David Tyfield, an expert in Chinese innovation at the U.K.'s Lancaster University, told CNBC that education technology is increasingly big business and there is no reason to doubt that it could be very effective. However, it doesn't come without challenges, he explained. \"There are obvious \u2014 and possibly superficial \u2014 technological challenges, in terms of access to the internet or even electricity,\" he said. \"But while many of these may be fast diminishing, we need to be careful not to underestimate how significant they still remain, especially in a country of the geographic and demographic size of China,\" he added.

This is how you stimulate an ecosystem. I\u2019ve seen so many interesting investors and entrepreneurs at RiseUp,\u201d said Sam Gichuru. Sam Gichuru is the founder and CEO of Nailab in Kenya, who was most recently selected by Jack Ma to lead, through Nailab, the Africa Netpreneur Prize Initiative, a $10M Initiative lead by Jack Ma foundation that seeks to discover, spotlight and support 10 African entrepreneurs every year for the next 10 years. Addressing the participants at the RiseUp Summit for the first time, Lamees Al Hadidi, Egyptian Television presenter, said: \u201cAlthough I never started my own business, I see myself as an entrepreneur, because entrepreneurship is a lifestyle and you can be an entrepreneur in your workplace by making sure you make a real difference\u201d. In her stage interview with young actress Sarrah Abdel Rahman, Al Hadidi said that \u201cThe idea of her prime-time television competition program \u201cHona El Shabab\u201d, was in itself a first and a risk she decided to take because people needed to see real hope from this ecosystem. Also because these innovators deserve the chance for exposure.\u201d This is what encouraged her to keep going and present the second season of the program with greater production and longer duration. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the success stories of entrepreneurs who were featured which was discussed for the first time in her program entitled \u201cHona El Shabab\u201d such as the transport company \u201cSwvl\u201d. Answering the question of how she wants to support entrepreneurs in the coming period, Hadidi said that \u201cI think that a seasonal program such as \u201cHona El Shabab\u201d is not enough to support these innovative entrepreneurs, so I want to continue my support through a digital platform that covers their news and follows their success stories throughout the year\u201d. Scientist and former NASA engineer Dr. Farouk El Baz said: \u201c \u201cYouth who have the energy are able to create and reform the best Egypt we want, and they must insist on achieving this. In the future, I want to share my experience with all the youth, especially Egyptians. I ask all of you here today to be a part of the future prosperity of the country.\u201d On a panel that asked the controversial question, \u201cAre humans ethical enough for Artificial Intelligence\u201d, Ryno Rjnsburger, CTO of Microsoft 4Afrika said: \u201cMicrosoft brought the power of personal computing to the world, and today is aiming to do the same with artificial intelligence \u2013 educate, democratize, and enable everyone on the planet to achieve more, while ensuring we are guided by strong principles that keep these developments on track. At Microsoft, we\u2019ve developed an internal advisory committee to help ensure our AI products adhere to these principles. We are also a co-founder of the Partnership on AI, an organization devoted to studying and formulating best practices on AI technologies, and we\u2019ve forged industry partnerships with both Amazon and Facebook to make AI more accessible to everyone,\u201d said Ryno Rijnsbrger, CTO, Microsoft 4Afrika. **RiseUp Pitch Competition** Nearly 300 start-ups applied to participate in the RiseUp Pitch Competition.

Argineering has created RGKit that it claims to be world\u2019s first plug-and-play gadget that could transform displays and exhibits into interactive spaces, with an easy-to-use process. Their tools make physical designs interact with people in what they say is the easiest way possible. RGKit can help create designs that detect passersby, lights that react to movement, objects that twirl and swirl, items that turn to touch sensors and a lot more. Argineering\u2019s solutions can be used in retail, exhibition, booths, live events, malls and many other places. The startup, as it says, eliminates obstacles of time, cost and the need for a high-tech engineer to do all the coding and electronics, that are normally there when designing experiences with physical interactions. Apart from the $50,000 investment, Argineering also won EGP 10,000 (~$550) worth of credit for Uber rides, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain course from IBM as well as membership to the bootstrap phase for the FBStart program by Facebook.

Let\u2019s see if Argineering can repeat something similar next year. ### Second Place \u2013 MayDay MayDay, a Cairo-based startup that provides on-demand roadside assistance through its mobile apps, won the second place. MayDay\u2019s apps could be used to request two trucks, tire change, battery jump start, and fuel. The startup that founded earlier this year has their services available in Cairo and Giza. The startup won EGP 5,000 (~$225) in Uber credits and access to FBStart by Facbeook, and Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain course from IBM. ### Third Place \u2013 VetWork The third prize was won by on-demand pet medical care startup VetWork. VetWork through its mobile apps provide home visits of Vet physicians, pet insurance plans, and grooming. Acoording to their website, they also have an online shop selling pet food and more. VetWork won EGP 2,500 (~$110) in Uber rides, access to FBStart by Facebook, and the Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain course from IBM. Both MayDay and VetWork also won fast tracking for Falak Startup bootcamp program but at least one of them has already graduated from Falak\u2019s accelerator program. ### Crowd Champion \u2013 Garment IO The crowd also had a chance to pick their favorite from ten pitches they saw and they went with Garment IO, a plug-and-play garment manufacturing management solution that combines software and hardware to help factory managers get the full picture of production processes, worker performance and production costs, all of which can be accessed online on Garment IO\u2019s web- based platform. The startup won a free attendance ticket to any European tech/startup event of their choice. ### Social Impact Award \u2013 Takestep Takestep, a web and mobile platform (it seems that they\u2019re not live for public yet) that connects all the stakeholders including patients, guardians, treatment facilities, and supervisors in the addiction recovery process, won the Social Impact Award. The platform connects patients with all these stakeholders on an ongoing basis to prevent them from relapsing.

RiseUp Summit concluded its sixth edition after three days of different activities in Cairo last week. The event was attended by over 6,000 people form 48 countries and featured talks and sessions by almost 300 speakers. RiseUp Summit 2018 also hosted 240 startups and close to 300 investors. For its pitch competition, RiseUp had received over 300 application from which 50 pre-seed stage startups were shortlisted to pitch to a panel of judges from leading VC funds angel groups of the region. The judges for initial round included Endure Capital\u2019s Waleed Khalil, Cairo Angels\u2019 Aly El Shalakany and Zeina Mandour, BECO Capital\u2019s Jad Antoun and Vinay Ramkumar, and Ahmed Al Jabreen from 500 Startups.

The investment will be made following due diligence. Argineering has created RGKit that it claims to be world\u2019s first plug-and-play gadget that could transform displays and exhibits into interactive spaces, with an easy-to-use process. Their tools make physical designs interact with people in what they say is the easiest way possible. RGKit can help create designs that detect passersby, lights that react to movement, objects that twirl and swirl, items that turn to touch sensors and a lot more. Argineering\u2019s solutions can be used in retail, exhibition, booths, live events, malls and many other places. The startup, as it says, eliminates obstacles of time, cost and the need for a high-tech engineer to do all the coding and electronics, that are normally there when designing experiences with physical interactions. Apart from the $50,000 investment, Argineering also won EGP 10,000 (~$550) worth of credit for Uber rides, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain course from IBM as well as membership to the bootstrap phase for the FBStart program by Facebook.

Now, both McClure and the VC firm he co-founded are taking steps to rebuild themselves, this time without one another.It was 2017, when McClure abruptly resigned from 500 Startups , retreating from the spotlight amid allegations from women that he\u2019d behaved inappropriately. He acknowledged he\u2019d made advances toward multiple women in work-related situations in a since-deleted blog posted titled \u201cI\u2019m a creep. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He handed the leadership reins to his 500 Startups co-founder, Christine Tsai . No legal action was taken against McClure or the firm.Today, McClure is working on a second act, albeit a lower-profile one. He\u2019s raising a new fund to invest in other venture firms worldwide, according to two people familiar with the plans. McClure declined to comment for this story. With the working title Practical Venture Capital, McClure\u2019s new effort will be vastly different from the early-stage venture work he built his career on, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The new fund is designed to purchase stakes in smaller funds, sometimes called micro-venture capital firms and also buy stakes from those funds\u2019 investors when they\u2019re seeking liquidity. The initial target for the fund is $100 million, although the final amount could be larger, the people said. McClure is the latest in a string of male venture capitalists unseated in the #MeToo movement who are now attempting to re-enter the industry by starting a fresh venture fund. Former Accel partner Fred Destin moved to Europe and helped raise more than $50 million for a firm called Stride.VC last summer. ![dave-500startups](/img/68574019/Master.jpg) _In pic: Dave McClure   _ A startup founder accused him of making unwanted advances at a party; Destin said at the time he misread the situation and had never used his position as a VC in an inappropriate way. Steve Jurvetson, who parted ways with Draper Fisher Jurvetson a little more than a year ago, raised a new $200 million fund called Future Ventures last month. Jurvetson had stepped down amid misconduct allegations, which he strenuously denied. The VCs follow other public figures accused of misconduct, including comedian Louis CK and Pixar co-founder John Lasseter , who have made controversial bids to reclaim their careers. 500 Startups, meanwhile, is adjusting to its own post-scandal reality\u2014without the leader who helped propel it to prominence. Started by McClure and Tsai in 2010, 500 Startups has stakes in Twilio Inc., Credit Karma Inc., Signapore\u2019s Grab and seven other companies each worth more than $1 billion, in addition to having a stable of portfolio companies notable for its female and international founders. By the time McClure left, 500 Startups\u2019 fund and accelerator had 150 employees. But recently, it has slimmed down its operations, Tsai confirmed to Bloomberg. The firm laid off what she described as a \u201chandful\u201d of people. Its Japanese division also recently broke off as an independent venture. \u201cWe decided to make some changes to our back-office departments in order to better scale the firm, which means a small number of people leaving the team,\u201d she wrote in an emailed statement. \u201cWe are also actively bringing in new hires for other departments.\u201d Tsai declined to elaborate further on the job cuts, saying only that it was part of a new chapter for the firm, which included last month\u2019s promotion of longtime employee, Tim Chae, to be the fourth general partner. \u201cI\u2019m excited about the year ahead,\u201d Tsai said in the statement. Despite its place in the VC firmament, even before McClure\u2019s departure, 500 Startups had struggled to raise its fourth fund in 2015. It lowered a $200 million target to $150 million in 2016. By September 2017, a few months after the scandal, the fund had raised just $62 million of that amount, according to the most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today, 500 Startups is raising fresh investment for its fifth global fund, expected to be the firm\u2019s largest ever, according to a person familiar with the plans who asked not to be identified because process is private. Tsai declined to comment on the fundraising, per SEC regulations, but told Bloomberg TV last year that Abu Dhabi Financial Group would be the anchor investor.

Within a month, McClure was removed from the accelerator after admitting to sexual misconduct and 500 Startups  started reckoning with the ramifications of his actions. Over the course of 2018, 500 saw some successes among its international operations, ending the year with $454 million committed across multiple funds, according to the company\u2019s chief executive, Christine Tsai. The firm\u2019s international operations kept humming with 500 Vietnam raising $14 million in an oversubscribed close and the Southeast Asian-focused fund, 500 TukTuks II, holding their initial close. Now, with its oversubscribed close of $33 million, 500 Falcons joins the ranks of geographically focused, 500-affiliated investment firms to raise capital as the firm\u2019s scandal recedes from view. In the intervening years since the launch of 500 Falcons and the fund\u2019s final close, the argument for investing in the Middle East and North Africa has only become more clear. The trend-line for investments in the Middle East continues to move up and to the right. Last year there were 366 investments made in Middle Eastern startups \u2014 the highest number on record.

The region\u2019s potential for growth was even mentioned in the statement from Careem\u2019s  chief executive and co-founder, Mudassir Sheikha, when he discussed the acquisition. \u201cJoining forces with Uber  will help us accelerate Careem\u2019s purpose of simplifying and improving the lives of people, and building an awesome organisation that inspires,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mobility and broader internet opportunity in the region is massive and untapped, and has the potential to leapfrog our region into the digital future.\u201d The 500 Falcons fund has also seen more modest successes of its own. One portfolio company, the Dubai-based transcription and note-taking service Wrappup, was acquired by Voicera for an undisclosed amount. And the firm has seen follow-on funding for its portfolio companies Souqalmal, a price comparison site for consumer lending and insurance; Jamalon, the region\u2019s largest online retailer of Arabic and English books; and Foodics, a point of sale system for restaurants. In all, the firm has invested in 105 startups since its launch. From its inception, the 500 Falcons fund has taken a holistic approach to investing in the region, according to Haider. \u201cThe region has long faced political and economic uncertainty, and a growing younger population that is looking to take charge and change things with their own hands. These youth have access to the same global wealth of information as anyone else. If they so choose, they\u2019re capable of achieving the same things anyone else in the world is,\u201d Haider wrote in 2017. \u201cThe Middle East and North Africa are among the last large regional ecosystems to rise up, and emerging markets tend to leapfrog adoption of innovations and technology at higher and higher frequencies.

But the US is slowly becoming the **best place to sell a product, not to build it,** and international startups are emerging to challenge their US competitors in their homeland. The US presents a key opportunity to increase customer base, get in front of downstream investors and unlock massive opportunities. This requires significant research and careful execution, but above all, a team\u2019s mindset and vision are critical to turn the wheel in the correct direction and _Americanise_ the company when the right time comes. ###  _Start with a global mindset: build local, scale global_ International teams can do cost-effective product development and achieve early sustainability much faster than their US competitors. The unlimited runway and the freedom to test out new markets are vital in creating global success stories with locally-incubated teams. ###  _Shift to an English-only workplace_ English is an enabler that boosts the whole team to become more efficient while operating across geographies. This universal culture sets the precedent as the team grows and drastically affects the company\u2019s destiny while recruiting, selling the product or raising funding in the US. ###  _Hire employees from a variety of backgrounds_ Cross-cultural diversity brings different skills and views to the table, while also strengthening the team\u2019s ability to expand the business. Communicating effectively around the globe helps the team build cross-border relationships and understand cultural nuances for doing business in different countries. ###  _Test different markets, but start with the US_ Entrepreneurs should not be afraid of the US market, in fact they should consider it a valuable opportunity and experiment with it from the early days. The US market, with different dynamics to the rest of the world, usually has a lot of competition but also has huge openings in niche verticals. International teams have to iterate the product, business model and market multiple times before achieving product-market-fit. The sooner this happens, the better. ###  _Get backed by respected investors_ Most investors in the US do not take international teams (with international traction) seriously, so try to reach them through people they respect. Convince local, prominent and resourceful investors first; warm introductions matter. Entrepreneurship is a game of attrition. Startups must continuously reinvent the business and pivot in new directions, based on feedback from the market, but the US is not just another market. Entrepreneurs need to have the right mindset from day one to experience the **micro failures that will lead to the macro successes.** ", "time": 1555027200, "value": 0}, {"text": "Todas las historias, todas las miradas, desde todos los rincones Muchas gracias por tu colaboraci\u00f3n.

Wer als Startup ins Silicon Valley zieht, der m\u00f6chte dort unter anderem frisches Kapital von den lokalen VCs einholen. Doch was gibt es dabei zu beachten? Im Rahmen des Pioneers 19 hat Marvin Liao, Partner beim Risikokapitalgeber 500startups, dem brutkasten drei Tipps dazu gegeben, worauf er als Investor achtet. ## 1\\. Das Marktpotenzial \u201cAls Investor m\u00f6chte ich sehen, dass das Team ein gro\u00dfes globales Problem l\u00f6st\u201d, sagt Liao: Die L\u00f6sung sollte nicht blo\u00df f\u00fcr den DACH-Raum geeignet sein, sondern Chancen f\u00fcr ein weltweites Rollout bieten. Der Markt per se sollte gro\u00df genug sein und daher entsprechendes Umsatzpotenzial vorweisen. Nur so kann es zu einem Multi-Milliarden-Dollar-Gesch\u00e4ft werden. Das Team sollte entsprechend die F\u00e4higkeit haben, das Problem zu l\u00f6sen. ## 2\\. Das Team Au\u00dferdem ist laut Liao die Frage wichtig, ob das Team die Kapazit\u00e4t hat, das Business zu skalieren. Dazu geh\u00f6rt auch, dass man nicht ortsabh\u00e4ngig ist und somit bereit ist, sein Gesch\u00e4ft global auszurollen. Wenn n\u00f6tig, dann muss das Team bereit sein, seine T\u00e4tigkeit in eine andere Stadt oder ein anderes Land zu verlegen. \u201cIch verstehe, dass viele \u00d6sterreicher Wien nicht verlassen wollen, denn dies ist eine wirklich wundervolle Stadt\u201d, sagt Liao: \u201cAber aus Sicht eines Investors ist es fraglich, ob man alle relevanten Fachkr\u00e4fte hier findet, wenn das Unternehmen auf 500 Mitarbeiter w\u00e4chst.\u201d Wenn dies nicht m\u00f6glich ist, dann sollte man an einen anderen Standort wechseln. ## 3\\. Das Mindset In einer Paneldiskussion im Rahmen des Pioneers 19 f\u00fchrten andere Investoren aus den USA an, dass europ\u00e4ische Founder auf die Frage nach der T\u00e4tigkeit des Unternehmens anders reagieren als Gr\u00fcnder aus den USA: Hierzulande fangen die Unternehmer an, ihr Produkt oder ihre Dienstleistung zu beschreiben \u2013 in den USA wiederum tendiert man dazu, die Vision oder die Mission des Unternehmens zu beschreiben. Die Diskutanten waren sich einig, dass dies den dortigen Startups hilft, auch schwierige Zeiten zu \u00fcberleben: Sie sehen eher das gro\u00dfe Ganze als die kleinen Stolpersteine, die auf dem Weg liegen. \u201cIch glaube auch, dass man sich eher auf die gro\u00dfe Vision als auf das Produkt konzentrieren sollte\u201d, sagt Liao: \u201cDas gilt vor allem f\u00fcr Early-Stage-Startups, denn deren Produkt wird sich definitiv im Lauf der Zeit noch komplett ver\u00e4ndern.\u201d ", "time": 1557446400, "value": 0}, {"text": "Unter den acht Finalisten konnte sich Storyball auf dem Pioneers19 als Startup des Jahres durchsetzen.

$215 million for the launch of a new homeownership program. EasyKnock said its new MoveAbility program enables homeowners to use their equity to purchase a new home before they leave their current house. The company buys the home, offering a lump sum of cash, then leases the house the customers for three to 18 months while they search for a new home. Existing investor Blumberg Capital led the Series A, which included a $12 million equity, according to the company. Both returning and new investors, including Montage Ventures, Kairos, FJ Labs, Correlation Ventures, 500 Start- ups, and Rubicon Ventures, also participated in the financing round. \u201cWe are continuing to create flexible homeownership products that enable homeowners to access their equity,\u201d said EasyKnock CEO Jarred Kessler. \u201cWith MoveAbility, we\u2019re offering homeowners autonomy of the process of bridging between their current home and their future home. As roughly 5 million homes are sold every year, millions of Americans can benefit from our program.\u201d ", "time": 1557792000, "value": 0}, {"text": "### \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a

", "time": 1557878400, "value": 0}, {"text": "**Tell me about the JustWears story.** I left my job at venture capital and started working full time on JustWears in September 2016. It took us 10 months to develop and test the product and branding before officially launching in July 2017 on Kickstarter. **Why the name JustWears?** There is a backstory for the name. We initially launched the brand as JoeyWears \u2013 because we invented a new pouch design to protect men\u2019s crown jewel, just like how joey is protected in the pouch. Unfortunately we didn\u2019t get the trademarks on time so we had to consider a rebrand. We reached out to our customers and crowdsourced what\u2019s the best name they would like to name us. Out of the 700-plus names we got, JustWears was repeatedly mentioned most. In their words:\u201d It is just so comfy, every man should just wear it.\u201d **How much JustWears has grown since it would founded?** Within the first 30 days of launch, we made a record for being the most backed apparel project on Kickatarter in the UK out of 720 projects, and top three in broader Europe. We received over $105,000 (\u00a380,350) pre-orders from 1500-plus customers across the world. Since then, we start trading through our online store. We have shipped about 13,000 pairs of underwear to more than 3000 customers in 73 countries. We\u2019ve achieved this with a very lean team of four people. We are on the track to get the first seven-figure turnover this year. **How does it feel to have achieved this?** The first thing I did when we hit the sales target was to call my parents in China and proudly told them \u201cI made it!\u201d Even until now, they still occasionally asked me when I can get a \u201cproper\u201d job. **What\u2019s it like having some high-profile people, like former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, wearing your products?** It\u2019s not everyday you get to congratulate a former Google CEO on his \u201cfantastic package\u201d. It keeps me smiling for probably three days. (laughs) > _**\u201cIt\u2019s not everyday you get to congratulate a former Google CEO on his \u2018fantastic package\u2019.\u201d**_ **Of all the types of businesses you could\u2019ve ventured into, why specifically mens\u2019 underwear?** I got a lot people asking me \u201cwhy you, as a woman, are innovating men\u2019s underwear?\u201d It started from my frustration with my partner\u2019s saggy underwear. He\u2019s never a fan of Calvin Klein. Underwear stood out as a market with little product innovation and antiquated brand messaging. As I looked deeper into this, I realised how badly most brands were missing the mark on what the majority of men care about most: comfort. This ultimately inspired us to go off start a company of our own. **Tell me about yourself. What were you doing before JustWears?** When I first moved to London from China four years ago, I had nothing but perfect Chinglish. I started working for one of the most active seed venture capital firm 500Startups, operating the investment program in London. **How has your previous experience aided you?** Coming from venture capital, I was fortunate to get to experience first hand how digitally native brands, powered by technology (ie: algorithm, personalised recommendation), are changing the landscape of retail. This helps me navigate the direction of the brand more clearly. **What gap in the UK retail market does JustWears strive to address?** We strive to provide men with premium basic wear that allows them to be their most comfortable and confident, no matter the occasion. We pride ourselves in creating functional and convenient solutions that will never compromise their comfort or style. **What\u2019s in store for your JustWears store for the rest of the year?** We\u2019ve gained lots of useful feedback and data from our community of customers. We\u2019re using this information to expand our product lines to offer more tailored production options. This includes new silhouettes (eg: briefs), as well as partnering with some up-and-coming artists to design a collection of really engaging prints. **How is your online retail business addressing some of the challenges facing the retail industry?** > _**\u201c** **Underwear stood out as a market with little product innovation and antiquated brand messaging\u201d**_ We uniquely own every step of our production and distribution process \u2014 from product design to packaging to marketing to fulfilment. We\u2019ve created a totally different retail experience than the high street brands. It is more accommodating, customer-friendly, and human. On top of that, we collect more than 70,000 data points, which traditional retail is not able to do so. **What is the most challenging aspect of your job?** When I first started out, hiring and managing people especially people who are older/senior than me (I\u2019m 26) was my biggest challenge. Now I am getting into the third year of fully investing myself into the business, and the challenge becomes more about the balance between work and life. I never switch off or got a chance to. Online retail means customers could come in anytime from anywhere. I have to stay on top of what\u2019s happening. **And the most rewarding?** Of course it would be seeing the growth on the business. Knowing that over thousands men in 73 countries are happily wearing our underwear brings an incredible amount of rewarding feeling to me. Often the anecdotal wins would lift my whole day \u2013 receiving customers\u2019 thanks letter for being inspiring, bumping into never-met customers in real life who called my name out, having Eric Schmidt wearing our pants, etc. **What advice would you give someone who is considering embarking on a career in retail?** Prepare to make sacrifices. Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. We often hear about how becoming a successful entrepreneur takes focus, discipline and ambition. But in a time when some companies achieve meteoric success in just a couple years, we don\u2019t often hear as much about the importance of patience and perseverance. _**Click here to sign up to Retail Gazette\u2018s free daily email newsletter**_ ", "time": 1557878400, "value": 0}, {"text": "![Injecting capital into the capital city](https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_Article2016_ControlFaceDetect/440608) __ __ Jumpspeed Venture Partners managing director Ben Wiener. (photo credit: DAVID SHERMAN/MADEINJLM) X ![](https://www.jpost.com/HttpHandlers/ShowImage.ashx?ID=427284) Dear Reader,   As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World. As one of our loyal readers, we ask you to be our partner. For $5 a month you will receive access to the following:   * A user experience almost completely free of ads   * Access to our Premium Section   * Content from the award-winning Jerusalem Report and our monthly magazine to learn Hebrew - Ivrit   * A brand new ePaper featuring the daily newspaper as it appears in print in Israel Help us grow and continue telling Israel\u2019s story to the world. Thank you, Ronit Hasin-Hochman, CEO, Jerusalem Post Group   Yaakov Katz, Editor-in-Chief   UPGRADE YOUR JPOST EXPERIENCE FOR 5$ PER MONTH Show me later When Pennsylvania-born corporate lawyer Ben Wiener emigrated to Israel in the summer of 1998, he was determined to work in Jerusalem\u2019s thriving start-up scene. Then home to four major venture capital funds and hundreds of angel investors, primarily American immigrants, it was a good time to be a Jerusalem-based entrepreneur. Optimism, however, turned to pessimism in the early 2000s as the dot-com bubble burst and Jerusalem became increasingly associated with the Second Intifada, rather than investments. While NDS and Mobileye did continue to grow in their Jerusalem homes into Israel\u2019s future record \u201cexits,\u201d Tel Aviv and surrounding neighborhoods quickly became the sole home for new aspiring entrepreneurs and ambitious start-ups. \u201cIn 2013, I started to work on my own start-up in Jerusalem. I was 43 years old, married with seven kids, had my own idea and needed a very small amount of money to get started,\u201d Wiener told The Jerusalem Post. \u201cI could not find any investment for that start-up, not even the first penny. The Tel Aviv investors were not that interested, and they were right \u2013 it was pretty crazy to be a Jerusalem-based founder in 2013.\u201d But Jerusalem, Wiener explains, was quietly undergoing a whole new renaissance of start-up activity, almost entirely unnoticed by investors. There are now over 500 start-ups located in the city. Yet they were beneficiaries of only a small percentage of the $6.47 billion of capital investments made in Israeli start-ups last year. \u201cIt occurred to me that there is no capital in the capital city. My city is the start-up and it is starting up again,\u201d Wiener said. \u201cIf somebody had a little bit of money, they could exploit the mismatch of supply and demand. If somebody had the ability to pick up the handful of great companies that are going to come out of this ecosystem, they would have a tremendous economic opportunity.\u201d In 2014, Wiener established Jumpspeed Venture Partners, the only micro-venture capital fund investing exclusively in startups born or based in Jerusalem.    After raising and investing a first fund of $3.3 million in 2014, Wiener has now closed a $17.7m. pre-seed investment fund, backed by over 80 American and European individuals, family offices and institutions. \u201cWhile the first fund was all Jewish investors, of whom most knew something about Jerusalem, this fund was totally different,\u201d Wiener said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Zionist charity. I presented them with the disparity of supply and demand in one of the top 30 start-up ecosystems in the world, and it\u2019s starved of capital. It was a purely economic pitch.\u201d Jumpspeed has invested in 18 start-ups to date, including tapping into the ultra-Orthodox and East Jerusalem\u2019s Arab entrepreneurial scenes. Almost 40% of portfolio companies are led by a female chief executive. Portfolio companies, which are increasingly gaining recognition far beyond Jerusalem, include award-winning air quality application BreezoMeter; AI- powered car dealership software-maker AutoLeadStar; car accident analysis system MDGo; and personalized testing tool for depression developer Genetika+. \u201cStart-up markets are risky and you never know what\u2019s going to turn around the bend, but I think all the trends are pointing positive,\u201d Wiener said. \u201cWe have more aliyah and more impressive people moving to Jerusalem, bringing their talents and entrepreneurial ideas into the ecosystem. I don\u2019t see any reason to think that it won\u2019t continue.\u201d Now is the time to join the news event of the year - The Jerusalem Post Annual Conference!

Li abbiamo visti nelle serie tv tipo Breaking Bad o The Wire, dove i protagonisti sono spacciatori di droga e criminali in fuga. E sono sempre pi\u00f9 popolari. Li usano quelli che frequentano i siti web di incontri quando vanno al primo appuntamento, quelli che vendono qualcosa su Ebay, quelli che hanno un amante, i manager che gestiscono affari delicati, e gli adolescenti, l\u2019ultima frontiera di questo mercato. Funziona cos\u00ec, secondo il Wall Street Journal: quando i genitori levano il telefono ai figli, questi prima protestano, poi si fanno di nascosto un burner phone; lo capisci perch\u00e9 improvvisamente non protestano pi\u00f9. Non si sono arresi: ti hanno fregato. Di questo fenomeno si parla da alcune anni. Precisamente dal 2012 quando due star della Silicon Valley come il fondatore di TechStars David Cohen e quello di 500startups Dave McClure decidono di sostenere Ad Hoc Labs, una piccola startup di Los Angeles che si era data una missione geniale. Questa: i telefonini usa e getta esistevano ed esistono, costano circa venti euro, fanno solo telefonate ed sms, sono piccoli e leggeri in modo che non hai la sensazione di portarti dietro un secondo telefono. Ma \u00e8 esattamente quello che stai facendo: vai in giro con due telefoni. Ad Hoc Labs invece ha sviluppato una app, Burner, che ti consente di avere un secondo numero di telefono, segreto e non intercettabile, sul tuo smartphone. Qualche mese dopo \u00e8 stata la volta di un\u2019altra app, Hushed, che vuol dire segreta, riservata, silenziosa: ha alle spalle una grossa azienda di telecomunicazioni, AffinityClick, e oggi funziona in pi\u00f9 di 60 paesi del mondo, Italia compresa. I prezzi sono davvero convenienti, pochi euro al mese, puoi scegliere se in abbonamento o con una prepagata a scalare, e hai il tuo numero segreto con cui, per esempio, registrarti di nascosto in qualche social network. \u00c8 una cosa buona o cattiva? Nessuna delle due: \u00e8 una esigenza, in questa epoca social, esibizionista e un po\u2019 fasulla, resiste l\u2019esigenza della riservatezza anche se non sei una spia o un gangster. Sicuramente per i genitori, che cercano di arginare la vita digitale dei figli, \u00e8 una sfida in pi\u00f9. E dimostra ancora una volta che pi\u00f9 dei divieti, serve il dialogo.

The resilience and problem-solving skills they learn are crucial when building and growing businesses. He explains: _\"Over the last 20 years, 25% of American venture-backed companies have been created by immigrants._ _There is a wealth of research which indicates that those who choose to migrate tend to be different from those who don't. They have a different pattern of motivation, abilities and adjustment. They are hungrier and more risk taking, with thicker skins. They become used to experiencing hardship and rejection, which are setbacks that all entrepreneurs must endure.\"_ This is why talent scouts are going to top universities and business schools in Asia to encourage the best students to come to their country, Adrian says. Those who agree to migrate show signs of entrepreneurial flair simply in their willingness to take on the challenge of moving. He adds: _\"Entrepreneurial migrants are most commonly found in the technology and engineering sectors. This is perhaps why there are around 500 start-ups with French founders just in the San Francisco Bay area of California.\"_ _\"Once they've relocated, most migrants also benefit from small but passionate social support networks. Immigrants create hubs within foreign countries and feel obliged to help each other succeed against the odds. Often, they can be counted on to provide reliable temporary workers when a fellow migrant entrepreneur hits hard times.\"_ ", "time": 1559433600, "value": 0}], "chart":
